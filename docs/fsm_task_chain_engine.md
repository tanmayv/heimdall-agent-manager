## 1. Executive Summary & Motivation

Heimdall orchestrates multi-agent task chains where autonomous agents cooperate to implement, review, test, and verify complex engineering workflows. The existing orchestration engine relies on a monolithic, level-triggered reconciliation pass (`reconcile_chain` in `src/hub/service/taskchain/promotion.odin`). 

While the level-triggered model performs well under static conditions, real-world multi-agent coordination exposes critical failure modes inherent to polling and level-based state evaluation:
1. **Silent Event Drops**: If an agent process crashes or bridge connectivity lapses between reconciliation cycles, tasks can be left indefinitely in `In_Progress` without an active worker ("orphan tasks").
2. **State Skew & Race Conditions**: `reconcile_chain` evaluates a point-in-time snapshot, commits status mutations to the SQLite repository, and then asynchronously dispatches WebSocket `wake_agent` commands (`run[]` / `stop[]`) to bridges. If bridge command delivery fails or times out, the database reflects a state that does not match physical reality.
3. **Trigger Gaps**: Reconcile is invoked only upon explicit triggers (e.g., manual CLI commands, task status updates, or votes). Setup-phase changes (task creation, priority updates, dependency additions) explicitly skip reconcile (noted by `NO auto-reconcile on create/update/dependency change`), leading to chain stall if the operator or coordinator neglects to run an explicit reconcile pass.
4. **Fragile Ad-Hoc Pointer Heuristics**: Ad-hoc workarounds such as BUG-49 (silent drops on empty `bridge_id`) and BUG-50 (assignee terminated by `stop[]` upon submitting a task for `In_Validation`) reveal that maintaining global state consistency via periodic full-table sweeps requires increasingly complex edge-case patching.

### The FSM Solution

The **Finite State Machine (FSM) Task Chain Engine** replaces the level-triggered sweep with an event-driven, deterministic state machine architecture:
- **Strictly Typed Discrete Events**: All state changes are driven by strongly typed event structs modeled as Odin tagged unions (`FSM_Event`).
- **Exhaustive 2D Transition Matrix**: Every `State × Event` pair is explicitly defined in an immutable transition table, categorizing each cell into a **Valid Transition**, an **Idempotent No-Op**, or an **Anomaly / Error**. Undefined states and silent drops are mathematically impossible.
- **Decoupled Atomic Action Executor**: Side effects (starting agent processes, stopping processes, emitting chat notifications, adjusting focus pointers) are separated into single-responsibility, atomic action descriptors (`FSM_Action`). Actions are executed asynchronously by an Action Executor, and their execution results (`Action_Completed`, `Action_Failed`, `Action_Timed_Out`) feed back into the FSM event queue as new events.
- **Continuous Invariant Enforcement**: Key safety invariants (e.g., single active work focus per instance, live process requirement for in-progress tasks, strict dependency satisfaction before work promotion) are verified continuously after every transition.
- **Watchdog Auditing & Model Simulation**: An automated invariant auditor and discrete-event simulator guarantee 100% state-space coverage and crash recovery from persisted event logs.

## 2. Analysis of Reconcile Failure Modes vs FSM Invariant Prevention

The table below maps the documented failure modes and edge cases discovered in `promotion.odin` to the structural invariants and transition guards enforced by the FSM Engine.

| Failure Mode ID | Existing `reconcile_chain` Vulnerability | Root Cause in Level-Triggered Design | FSM Invariant & Mechanism | FSM Guarantee |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FM-1: Orphaned Work Task** | Task remains in `In_Progress`, but assigned agent process died or instance was deleted. | `reconcile_chain` only checks `instance_is_live` when deciding to send `stop[]` or `run[]`. If no trigger occurs, the dead agent's task is stuck forever. | **INV-LIVE-ASSIGNEE**: A task in `In_Progress` MUST have an instance where `runtime_status == .Running` and `current_task_id == task_id`. | Agent process exit generates `Agent_Process_Exited` / `Agent_Process_Crashed` event. Task immediately transitions to `Worker_Lost` -> `Starting_Worker` (auto-restart) or demotes to `Queued` with coordinator alert. |
| **FM-2: Split-Brain / Stale Focus Pointers** | Instance holds focus pointer to Task A, but Task A was completed, cancelled, or blocked by a newly added dependency. | Pointer clearing in `apply_instance_focus_total` runs as a post-pass. Intermediate states allow instances to believe they are working on dead tasks. | **INV-SINGLE-FOCUS**: Each instance has at most 1 active focus pointer. Any terminal task transition atomically clears or transfers focus. | When Task A transitions to `Completed` or `Paused`, the FSM atomically emits `Clear_Focus_Action(instance_id)`. Instance cannot hold dangling pointers. |
| **FM-3: Silent Bridge Drop** | Wake command discarded because instance has empty `bridge_id` or bridge is offline (`promotion.odin:962`). | `runs[""]` bucket is discarded; `eprintfln` log emitted but no durable error state or retry is recorded. Task stays `In_Progress` without a worker. | **INV-BRIDGE-REACHABILITY**: Action `Start_Agent` requires a valid, connected bridge. | Bridge unreachability triggers `Action_Failed(Reason.Bridge_Offline)`. FSM transitions task to `Bridge_Pending` with exponential retry timer and surfaces blocker event to coordinator. |
| **FM-4: Reconcile Trigger Gaps** | Coordinator adds a blocker dependency to Task B, but does not invoke `reconcile`. Task B continues running in violation of dependencies. | Explicit design choice (`taskchain_service.odin:2027`): dependency additions deliberately do not auto-reconcile to allow staging. | **INV-DEP-PRECEDENCE**: No task may enter or stay in `In_Progress` if any dependency is incomplete. | `Task_Dependency_Added` event immediately evaluated by FSM. If task is `In_Progress`, it transitions to `Queued` or `Blocked`, and `Stop_Agent_Action` is emitted. |
| **FM-5: Premature Assignee Termination (BUG-50)** | Submitting task for validation previously cleared assignee focus, causing `reconcile_chain` to kill the assignee process via `stop[]`. | Conflating "not currently doing active code work" with "process must be stopped". Assignee needs to stay alive to receive review verdict. | **INV-VALIDATION-STABILITY**: Assignee remains bound in `Awaiting_Review` state until validation resolves. | `Task_Submitted_For_Validation` transitions task to `In_Validation` and instance to `Active_Awaiting_Review`. No `Stop_Agent_Action` emitted until terminal `Completed` or explicitly demoted. |
| **FM-6: Concurrent Review Vote Corruptions** | Multiple reviewers cast votes simultaneously. Multiple reconcile passes race, causing duplicate state updates or skipped finalization. | Level-triggered reconcile re-evaluates all votes via SQL query `taskchain_list_votes_by_task`. Concurrent writes can produce duplicate status notifications. | **INV-QUORUM-MONOTONIC**: Review quorum evaluated transactionally on each `Task_Vote_Received` event. | Review votes are serialized through the FSM event queue. Quorum condition evaluated atomically; emits exactly one `Task_Approved` or `Task_Rejected` event. |
| **FM-7: Action Execution Desync (DB vs Wire)** | Hub marks task `In_Progress` in SQLite (`promotion.odin:887`), but WebSocket connection to bridge drops before `wake_agent` is sent. | Status update precedes action execution confirmation (speculative mutation). | **INV-TWO-PHASE-PROMOTION**: Task enters `Starting_Worker` until `Action_Completed(Start_Agent)` is reported back. | Database reflects true physical state. If start fails, task reverts to `Queued` without ghost executions. |

## 3. Formal Data Models & Type Specifications in Odin (REQ-FSM-1)

The FSM Engine is specified in native Odin idioms: strongly typed enums, tagged unions for polymorphic event and action payloads, and explicit struct definitions.

### 3.1 Task Lifecycle States (`Task_FSM_State`)

```odin
package fsm_engine

import "core:time"
import "../../domain"

// Task_FSM_State models the complete, fine-grained lifecycle of a task within a chain.
Task_FSM_State :: enum {
    Draft,                  // Task is being defined; not yet published.
    Assigned,               // Published with assignee/reviewer roles; waiting for dependencies.
    Blocked,                // Dependencies unsatisfied; strictly non-actionable.
    Queued,                 // Dependencies satisfied; waiting for worker instance allocation.
    Starting_Worker,        // Worker instance launch requested; awaiting Start_Agent confirmation.
    In_Progress,            // Worker instance confirmed live; actively executing task.
    In_Validation,          // Implementation submitted; awaiting reviewer votes / quorum.
    Validated_Not_Good,     // Reviewer rejected (NGTM); awaiting worker resumption or reassignment.
    Completed,              // Terminal: LGTM quorum met; dependents unblocked.
    Cancelled,              // Terminal: Task abandoned by coordinator or operator.
    Failed,                 // Terminal: Unrecoverable error (e.g. fatal bridge failure, retry exhaustion).
}

// Reports whether the state represents a terminal status.
task_state_is_terminal :: proc(state: Task_FSM_State) -> bool {
    return state == .Completed || state == .Cancelled || state == .Failed
}

// Reports whether the state unblocks downstream dependencies.
task_state_unblocks_dependents :: proc(state: Task_FSM_State) -> bool {
    return state == .Completed || state == .Cancelled
}
```

### 3.2 Instance Lifecycle States (`Instance_FSM_State`)

```odin
// Instance_FSM_State models the execution state of an agent instance relative to the chain.
Instance_FSM_State :: enum {
    Unallocated,            // Known identity/template, but no runtime process launched.
    Spawning,               // Process creation dispatched to bridge; waiting for handshake.
    Idle_Warm,              // Process live on bridge; no current task focus; ready for instant dispatch.
    Active_Work,            // Process live; focused on executing an In_Progress task.
    Active_Awaiting_Review, // Process live; worker waiting for review verdict (BUG-50 preservation).
    Active_Review,          // Process live; focused on reviewing an In_Validation task.
    Terminating,            // Stop signal sent to bridge; awaiting process exit.
    Stopped,                // Process exited cleanly; ready for restart or reclamation.
    Faulted,                // Process crashed, timed out, or bridge lost; awaiting recovery.
}
```

### 3.3 FSM Events (`FSM_Event`)

Every state transition is triggered by an explicit `FSM_Event`. Events are immutable and carry context-specific payloads.

```odin
// FSM_Event_Payload is a tagged union encompassing all possible event sources.
FSM_Event_Payload :: union {
    // Task Lifecycle Events
    Event_Task_Created,
    Event_Task_Published,
    Event_Task_Dependencies_Resolved,
    Event_Task_Dependency_Added,
    Event_Task_Start_Requested,
    Event_Task_Submitted_For_Validation,
    Event_Task_Vote_Received,
    Event_Task_Cancelled,
    Event_Task_Reset,

    // Instance & Process Lifecycle Events
    Event_Agent_Spawn_Dispatched,
    Event_Agent_Process_Started,
    Event_Agent_Process_Exited,
    Event_Agent_Process_Crashed,
    Event_Agent_Heartbeat_Timeout,

    // Bridge & Fleet Events
    Event_Bridge_Connected,
    Event_Bridge_Disconnected,
    Event_Fleet_Capacity_Available,

    // Asynchronous Action Feedback Events
    Event_Action_Completed,
    Event_Action_Failed,
    Event_Action_Timed_Out,

    // Watchdog & Audit Events
    Event_Watchdog_Tick,
    Event_Invariant_Anomaly_Detected,
}

FSM_Event :: struct {
    event_id:       string,
    chain_id:       domain.Task_Chain_ID,
    task_id:        domain.Task_ID,       // Optional: relevant task
    instance_id:    string,               // Optional: relevant agent instance
    timestamp:      time.Time,
    sequence_num:   u64,
    payload:        FSM_Event_Payload,
}

    reviewer_instance_id: string,
    result:               enum { LGTM, NGTM },
    feedback:             string,
}

```

### 3.4 Atomic FSM Actions (`FSM_Action`)

The FSM Engine produces zero direct external mutations. Instead, transition functions return a sequence of atomic, single-responsibility `FSM_Action` descriptors.

```odin
Action_Type :: enum {
    Start_Agent,
    Stop_Agent,
    Nudge_Agent,
    Set_Focus,
    Clear_Focus,
    Persist_Task_State,
    Persist_Instance_State,
    Emit_Chat_Notification,
    Schedule_Timer,
    Cancel_Timer,
}

Action_Payload :: union {
    Action_Start_Agent,
    Action_Stop_Agent,
    Action_Nudge_Agent,
    Action_Set_Focus,
    Action_Clear_Focus,
    Action_Persist_Task_State,
    Action_Persist_Instance_State,
    Action_Emit_Chat_Notification,
    Action_Schedule_Timer,
    Action_Cancel_Timer,
}

FSM_Action :: struct {
    action_id:     string,
    chain_id:      domain.Task_Chain_ID,
    task_id:       domain.Task_ID,
    instance_id:   string,
    action_type:   Action_Type,
    created_at:    time.Time,
    payload:       Action_Payload,
}

Action_Start_Agent :: struct {
    bridge_id:     string,
    agent_id:      string,
    agent_name:    string,
    role:          string, // "worker" | "reviewer"
    provider:      string,
    tier:          string,
    project_path:  string,
}

Action_Stop_Agent :: struct {
    bridge_id:     string,
    reason:        string,
}

Action_Nudge_Agent :: struct {
    message:       string,
    backoff_count: int,
}

Action_Set_Focus :: struct {
    new_task_id: domain.Task_ID,
    role:        domain.Current_Task_Role,
}

Action_Clear_Focus :: struct {}

Action_Persist_Task_State :: struct {
    new_status: Task_FSM_State,
    started_at: string,
    completed_at: string,
}

Action_Persist_Instance_State :: struct {
    new_state: Instance_FSM_State,
    status_message: string,
}

Action_Emit_Chat_Notification :: struct {
    recipient_id: string, // user | agent_instance_id
    body:         string,
    message_type: string,
}

Action_Schedule_Timer :: struct {
    timer_id:         string,
    duration:         time.Duration,
    timeout_event:    FSM_Event_Payload,
}

Action_Cancel_Timer :: struct {
    timer_id: string,
}
```

### 3.5 Formal State Invariants

The FSM Engine enforces six non-negotiable structural invariants:

```odin
// Invariant verification procedure signature. Returns true if valid, false + error if violated.
State_Invariant_Proc :: #type proc(state: ^Chain_Aggregate_State) -> (ok: bool, violation: string)

// INV-1: Single-Focus Invariant
// An agent instance may hold an active focus pointer to at most one task in the entire system.
check_invariant_single_focus :: proc(state: ^Chain_Aggregate_State) -> (bool, string) {
    for inst_id, inst in state.instances {
        if inst.focus_task_id != "" {
            if inst.focus_role == .None {
                return false, fmt.tprintf("Instance %s has focus task %s but role is None", inst_id, inst.focus_task_id)
            }
        }
    }
    return true, ""
}

// INV-2: Live-Assignee Invariant
// A task in In_Progress MUST have an active assignee instance whose runtime process is confirmed live.
check_invariant_live_assignee :: proc(state: ^Chain_Aggregate_State) -> (bool, string) {
    for task_id, task in state.tasks {
        if task.state == .In_Progress {
            if task.assignee_instance_id == "" {
                return false, fmt.tprintf("Task %s is In_Progress with no assignee instance", task_id)
            }
            inst, exists := state.instances[task.assignee_instance_id]
            if !exists || inst.state != .Active_Work {
                return false, fmt.tprintf("Task %s is In_Progress but assignee %s is in state %v", task_id, task.assignee_instance_id, inst.state)

            for dep_id in task.dependencies {
                dep, dep_exists := state.tasks[dep_id]
                if !dep_exists || !task_state_unblocks_dependents(dep.state) {
                    return false, fmt.tprintf("Task %s is %v but dependency %s is in state %v", task_id, task.state, dep_id, dep.state)
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return true, ""
}

// INV-4: Monotonic-Completion Invariant
// Terminal states (Completed, Cancelled, Failed) are strictly absorbing; once entered, no transition may exit them.
check_invariant_monotonic_completion :: proc(prev: Task_FSM_State, next: Task_FSM_State) -> (bool, string) {
    if task_state_is_terminal(prev) && next != prev {
        return false, fmt.tprintf("Terminal state violation: attempted transition from %v to %v", prev, next)
    }
    return true, ""
}

// INV-5: Bridge-Affinity Invariant
// An agent instance cannot be dispatched to an offline bridge or have an empty bridge binding.
check_invariant_bridge_affinity :: proc(state: ^Chain_Aggregate_State) -> (bool, string) {

                return false, fmt.tprintf("Instance %s is %v on offline/empty bridge %s", inst_id, inst.state, inst.bridge_id)
            }
        }
    }
    return true, ""
}

// INV-6: Quorum-Integrity Invariant
// A task may only transition from In_Validation to Completed if the number of LGTM votes meets or exceeds the required threshold with ZERO unaddressed NGTM votes.
check_invariant_quorum_integrity :: proc(task: ^Task_Entity) -> (bool, string) {
    if task.state == .Completed {
        if task.ngtm_count > 0 {
            return false, fmt.tprintf("Task %s completed with %d active NGTM votes", task.task_id, task.ngtm_count)

    }
    return true, ""
}
```

## 4. Exhaustive 2D Transition Matrix (REQ-FSM-2)

The core of the FSM is an exhaustive 2-dimensional transition matrix: `State × Event -> (Next_State, []Action)`.
To guarantee mathematically that no event is silently dropped, every cell in the matrix is classified into one of three explicit behaviors:
- **`[TRANS]` Valid Transition**: Modifies the entity state, schedules persistent mutations, and emits atomic action payloads.
- **`[NO-OP]` Idempotent No-Op**: State is maintained without side effects (e.g. duplicate vote, redundant dependency resolved event). Prevents jitter and redundant I/O.
- **`[ANOM]` Anomaly / Error**: The event is illegal for the current state. The FSM records an auditable anomaly record, triggers a non-disruptive self-healing check, and emits a diagnostic alert without crashing.

### 4.1 Task Lifecycle Transition Matrix

Below is the complete 2D matrix mapping all `Task_FSM_State` states against all relevant lifecycle events.

| Current Task State | `Task_Published` | `Deps_Resolved` | `Dep_Added` | `Start_Requested` | `Action_Completed(Start)` | `Action_Failed(Start)` | `Submitted_Validation` | `Vote_Received(LGTM)` | `Vote_Received(NGTM)` | `Agent_Crashed` | `Task_Cancelled` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Draft`** | **`[TRANS]`** -> `Assigned` (if deps satisfied -> `Queued`) | `[NO-OP]` Hold in Draft | `[NO-OP]` Add dep record | `[ANOM]` Draft not runnable | `[ANOM]` Unexpected start | `[ANOM]` Unexpected fail | `[ANOM]` Illegal handoff | `[ANOM]` No review in draft | `[ANOM]` No review in draft | `[NO-OP]` No agent bound | **`[TRANS]`** -> `Cancelled` |
| **`Assigned`** | `[NO-OP]` Already published | **`[TRANS]`** -> `Queued` | `[NO-OP]` Record dep | **`[TRANS]`** -> `Starting_Worker` | `[ANOM]` Not starting | `[ANOM]` Not starting | `[ANOM]` Illegal submit | `[ANOM]` Not in validation | `[ANOM]` Not in validation | `[NO-OP]` No live worker | **`[TRANS]`** -> `Cancelled` |

| **`Queued`** | `[NO-OP]` Already published | `[NO-OP]` Already resolved | **`[TRANS]`** -> `Blocked` | **`[TRANS]`** -> `Starting_Worker` | `[ANOM]` Not starting | `[ANOM]` Not starting | `[ANOM]` Illegal submit | `[ANOM]` Not in validation | `[ANOM]` Not in validation | `[NO-OP]` No live worker | **`[TRANS]`** -> `Cancelled` |
| **`Starting_Worker`** | `[NO-OP]` Redundant | `[NO-OP]` Redundant | **`[TRANS]`** -> `Blocked` + Stop Action | `[NO-OP]` Spawn in progress | **`[TRANS]`** -> `In_Progress` + Set_Focus | **`[TRANS]`** -> `Queued` (Retry / Backoff) | `[ANOM]` Cannot submit during spawn | `[ANOM]` Not in validation | `[ANOM]` Not in validation | **`[TRANS]`** -> `Queued` + Alert | **`[TRANS]`** -> `Cancelled` + Stop Action |

### 4.3 Anomaly Event Handling & Diagnostics

When an `[ANOM]` cell is encountered, the FSM guarantees stability through three principles:
1. **Never Panic**: An illegal event does not terminate the engine or corrupt state.
2. **Auditable Anomaly Record**: The engine records the event timestamp, entity state, event type, and caller identity in the SQLite `taskchain_anomalies` log.
3. **Corrective Feedback**: If an event indicates severe state divergence (e.g. an agent process attempts to submit validation for a task that is marked `Assigned`), the FSM emits a `Nudge_Agent_Action` informing the agent of the true state, and triggers an immediate invariant check.

---

## 5. Decoupled Action Executor & Event Feedback Loop (REQ-FSM-3)

In the level-triggered architecture, business logic and side effects were intertwined inside `reconcile_chain`: SQLite transactions, WebSocket message formatting, and network calls were executed sequentially in a single synchronous thread.

The FSM Engine decouples pure state evaluation from side-effect execution via a **Decoupled Action Executor** and **Asynchronous Feedback Loop**.

```

### 5.2 Decoupled Action Pipeline & Feedback Contracts

1. **Step 1: Event Dequeue & State Evaluation**
   The FSM Evaluator pops `FSM_Event` from `EQ`. It executes pure transition logic in memory, producing `Next_State` and `[]FSM_Action`.
2. **Step 2: Invariant Check & Optimistic Staging**
   The 6 formal state invariants are evaluated against the staged state. If valid, state is committed to memory, and actions are pushed to `AQ`.
3. **Step 3: Asynchronous Non-Blocking Execution**
   Workers pop actions from `AQ`. Workers do not block the FSM thread. Network retries, exponential backoffs, and WebSocket writes occur independently in worker threads.
4. **Step 4: Feedback Event Generation**
   Every action executor produces an explicit outcome event:
   - On success: Emits `Event_Action_Completed{ action_id, action_type }`.
   - On error: Emits `Event_Action_Failed{ action_id, action_type, error_code, message }`.
   - On timeout: Emits `Event_Action_Timed_Out{ action_id, action_type, timeout_duration }`.
5. **Step 5: Feedback Ingestion**
   The feedback event enters `EQ`, allowing the FSM to transition the entity to confirmed running states, trigger retries, or escalate failures to the coordinator.

## 6. Testing, Simulation & Watchdog Audit Strategies (REQ-FSM-4)

To ensure enterprise reliability, the FSM Engine incorporates three verification pillars:
1. **Deterministic Model Simulator**: Exhaustively explores the state space in-memory without network or filesystem dependencies.
2. **Watchdog Audit Engine**: Periodically inspects persistent storage to detect and correct state divergence caused by external modifications or unhandled crashes.
3. **Write-Ahead Event Log & Crash Recovery**: Ensures crash resilience through event sourcing and state replay.

### 6.1 State-Space Simulation & Model Checker

The simulation framework models the task chain engine as a closed, deterministic universe. It uses pseudo-random event sequence generation (Monte Carlo testing) to explore concurrency anomalies:

```odin
// Simulation test harness in Odin
Simulation_Harness :: struct {
    fsm:              FSM_Core,
    event_history:    [dynamic]FSM_Event,
    action_history:   [dynamic]FSM_Action,
    chaos_drop_rate:  f32, // Probability of simulated network/bridge packet loss
}

// Executes N random transitions across M concurrent tasks. Verifies all invariants after every step.
run_simulation_fuzz_test :: proc(steps: int, task_count: int, seed: u64) -> (bool, string) {
    harness: Simulation_Harness
    init_simulation_harness(&harness, task_count, seed)
    defer destroy_simulation_harness(&harness)

    for step in 0..<steps {
        event := generate_random_valid_or_chaos_event(&harness)
        step_ok, step_err := dispatch_simulation_event(&harness, event)
        if !step_ok {
            return false, fmt.tprintf("Simulation step %d failed on event %v: %s", step, event.payload, step_err)
        }

        // Exhaustive Invariant Evaluation on every step
        inv_ok, inv_violation := evaluate_all_invariants(&harness.fsm.state)
        if !inv_ok {
            return false, fmt.tprintf("Invariant violation at step %d: %s", step, inv_violation)
        }
    }
    return true, "Simulation completed with 100% invariant compliance"
}
```

#### Simulation Coverage Metrics
- **State Coverage**: 100% of all declared `Task_FSM_State` and `Instance_FSM_State` states reached.
- **Transition Coverage**: 100% of defined `[TRANS]`, `[NO-OP]`, and `[ANOM]` matrix cells exercised.
- **Chaos Injection**: 5% dropped actions, 5% bridge disconnections, 5% random agent process crashes. The engine must self-heal to terminal completion without operator intervention.

### 6.2 Watchdog Audit Engine

While the FSM is strictly event-driven, runtime environments can suffer unforeseen anomalies (e.g. database administrator manual edits, process SIGKILL without socket notification, physical bridge host reboot).

The **Watchdog Audit Engine** runs as a periodic, low-priority background timer (default: every 30 seconds):
1. **Out-of-Band State Scan**: Reads raw SQLite tables (`taskchain_tasks`, `agent_instances`, `bridges`) directly, bypassing FSM memory caches.
2. **Invariant Verification**: Evaluates all 6 State Invariants against the database state.
3. **Discrepancy Remediation**: If a discrepancy is detected (e.g., Task is `In_Progress` in SQLite, but the instance process is not running on the bridge):
   - The Watchdog **does NOT** perform direct SQL updates.
   - The Watchdog **enqueues an `Event_Invariant_Anomaly_Detected`** into the FSM Event Queue.
   - The FSM receives the anomaly event and executes a standard, deterministic recovery transition (e.g., demotes task to `Queued` or schedules `Start_Agent`).

### 6.3 Write-Ahead Log (WAL) & Crash Recovery

To withstand sudden Hub daemon crashes or power failures:
1. **Append-Only Event Store**: Every event ingested by `EQ` is written to an append-only SQLite table `taskchain_event_log` before transition evaluation (`fsync` / WAL mode).
2. **Periodic State Snapshotting**: Every 100 events, an atomic snapshot of the aggregate state is written to `taskchain_fsm_snapshots`.
3. **Recovery Sequence on Startup**:
   - Step A: Load the latest snapshot from `taskchain_fsm_snapshots`.
   - Step B: Query `taskchain_event_log` for all events with `sequence_num > snapshot.last_sequence_num`.
   - Step C: Replay events in strict monotonic sequence through the FSM Evaluator with action execution disabled (rebuilding in-memory state).
   - Step D: Run the Watchdog Invariant Checker to verify alignment with external bridges.
   - Step E: Resume live action dispatch.

## 7. Implementation Roadmap & Phased Migration

To transition safely from `reconcile_chain` to the FSM Engine without interrupting active production chains, a 3-phase migration plan is specified:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    P1[Phase 1: Shadow Execution] --> P2[Phase 2: Action Executor Cutover] --> P3[Phase 3: Reconcile Deprecation]
    
    subgraph P1 Details
        P1A[FSM runs in parallel with reconcile]
        P1B[Actions logged but not executed]
        P1C[Diffing engine compares reconcile vs FSM decisions]
    end

    subgraph P2 Details
        P2A[Flag: --engine=fsm enabled per chain]
        P2B[FSM Action Executor dispatches live WS commands]
        P2C[reconcile_chain disabled for FSM chains]
    end

    subgraph P3 Details
        P3A[FSM engine becomes default]
        P3B[Remove promotion.odin reconcile sweep]
        P3C[Keep Watchdog Audit as safety net]
    end
```

### Phase 1: Shadow Execution Mode (Zero Risk)
- `reconcile_chain` remains the authoritative orchestrator.
- On every reconcile trigger and state mutation, events are mirrored to the FSM Engine.
- The FSM computes transitions and actions, writing decisions to a comparison log (`taskchain_engine_diffs`).
- Discrepancies between `reconcile_chain` actions and FSM actions are analyzed and reconciled until 100% behavioral parity is achieved.

### Phase 2: Per-Chain Feature Flag Cutover
- Introduce chain configuration option: `engine = "fsm" | "legacy_reconcile"`.
- Chains configured with `engine = "fsm"` route all mutations through the FSM Event Queue and Action Executor.
- `reconcile_chain` immediately no-ops on chains with `engine = "fsm"`.
- Canary deployment on internal development and testing task chains.

### Phase 3: Legacy Reconcile Deprecation & Cleanup
- The FSM Engine becomes the global default for all task chains.
- Monolithic scanning code in `promotion.odin` (`reconcile_chain`, `apply_instance_focus_total`) is removed.
- Repository operations become strictly event-driven.
- Watchdog Audit Engine remains active as the continuous self-healing safety net.

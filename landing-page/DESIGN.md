## 1. Visual Language & Design Tokens

### 1.1 Aesthetic Philosophy
The Heimdall landing page uses an understated, modern developer-platform aesthetic (inspired by Linear, Tailscale, and Oxide):
- **Typography Pairing**: Clean, crisp sans-serif (`Inter`) for all headings, body text, and UI navigation; monospaced (`JetBrains Mono`) strictly for code blocks, CLI commands, and terminal outputs.
- **Understated Dark Theme**: Deep charcoal/slate background (`#0a0c10`) with layered slate surfaces (`#151922`), crisp borders (`#1e2430` / `#293242`), and clean contrast without blinding neon glows.
- **Clean Atmospheric Texture**: Subtle 40px grid overlay without noisy scanlines, arcade scan effects, or garish glowing blobs.
- **Restrained Accents**: Calm sky blue (`#38bdf8`) for interactive focus and highlights, paired with muted emerald (`#10b981`) for live connections and amber (`#f59e0b`) for tasks in validation.

### 3.3 Architectural Guarantees & Capabilities Grid (`<div class="caps-grid">`)
A grounded 6-card architectural capability grid highlighting concrete engineering attributes rather than speculative marketing numbers:

| Pillar | Capability | Technical Detail |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Runtime** | **Native Odin Binary** | Single static C-ABI binary; zero external Docker, Node, or Python runtime dependencies |
| **Footprint** | **~20MB Resident RAM** | Lightweight native daemon operating under standard systemd (Linux) or launchd (macOS) |
| **Networking** | **Outbound-Only Tunnels** | Outbound TLS WebSockets traverse NAT and firewalls with zero open inbound ports |
| **Security** | **Client-Side AES-GCM** | 256-bit Zero-Knowledge encryption; keys remain strictly local in POSIX 0600 files |
| **Quality** | **Enforced Review Gates** | Multi-agent task lifecycle requires explicit reviewer LGTM verification before code merges |
| **Control** | **Work Alongside Fleet** | Integrated file editor, native Git diff inspector, and live streaming PTY shell takeover |

### 3.4 Hero Media Window & GIF Placeholder (`<section class="hero-media-section" id="demo">`)

  - Active session title: `heimdall — multi-device coordination & review quorum demo`.
  - Status pill: `● Live Fleet Session` (indicating active connection).
- **Media Frame & GIF Placeholder**:
  - 16:9 aspect ratio container (`.gif-placeholder`) styled with a clean slate background (`#0e1117`), subtle dashed border, and centered play icon.
  - Title: `[ hero-demo.gif placeholder ]`.
  - Explanatory description: *"Product walk-through recording placeholder: showing coordinator task chain planning, worker parallel execution in isolated PTYs across multiple devices, and reviewer LGTM quorum verification."*
  - Asset metadata badges: `Asset: ./assets/hero-demo.gif` · `Target: 1200 × 680 px` · `Loop: 6–8s`.
  - Future drop-in ready: when the user records `hero-demo.gif` and drops it into `landing-page/assets/`, it replaces the placeholder directly.

## 4. The 5 Core Feature Pillars

### Pillar 1: Bring Your Own Agents Across Multiple Devices (BYOA Fleet)
- **The Problem**: Developers use multiple physical machines (laptop, Linux workstation, homelab server, cloud GPU VM) and varied agent frameworks (Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, OpenCode, Aider, custom scripts). Running them means juggling disconnected terminal windows, losing context, and manual state synchronization.
- **The Heimdall Solution**:
  - Connect any device with a single-command installer (`curl -fsSL https://get.heimdall.dev/install.sh | bash`).
  - Seamlessly run your choice of agent harness on any connected bridge.
  - View and orchestrate your entire multi-device agent fleet from one unified, reactive cockpit.

### Pillar 2: Seamless Multi-Agent Coordination & Quorum Verification
- **The Problem**: AI coding agents operating in silos hallucinate requirements, make unverified assumptions, overwrite working code, and lack peer review.
- **The Heimdall Solution**:
  - Coordinator agents maintain the living specification, decomposing high-level objectives into structured, self-contained task DAGs.
  - Specialized worker agents execute tasks in parallel with isolated dependencies.
  - Independent reviewer agents run verification suites and cast mandatory `LGTM` quorums with concrete evidence before changes land in your repo.

### Pillar 3: Security-First Architecture (Client-Side Zero-Knowledge Encryption)
- **The Problem**: Centralized multi-agent platforms upload workspace credentials, environment variables, source code, and API keys to central cloud databases in plaintext.
- **The Heimdall Solution**:
  - Client-side Zero-Knowledge encryption: all data leaving your machine is wrapped in 256-bit AES-GCM envelopes (`vault:v1:...`).
  - The central Hub is zero-knowledge: it coordinates tasks and logs without ever seeing your repository code, prompts, or API keys in plaintext.
  - Encryption keys stay strictly on your local machine (`~/.config/heimdall/vault_key`, mode `0600`).

### Pillar 4: Zero-Config Remote Access (No SSH, No VPN, No Port Forwarding)
- **The Problem**: Accessing your development workstation or homelab agent fleet on the go requires brittle SSH tunnels, dynamic DNS, Tailscale/VPN configs, or punching holes in router firewalls.
- **The Heimdall Solution**:
  - Engineered from day one for seamless remote development.
  - Heimdall bridges establish secure, persistent outbound WebSocket tunnels to the Hub.
  - Pick up your work, inspect agent progress, and trigger tasks from anywhere in the world without opening a single inbound port or configuring a VPN.

### Pillar 5: Work Alongside Your Fleet (Editor, VCS & Interactive Shell)
- **The Problem**: AI agent tools often operate as opaque black boxes behind chat prompts, leaving developers disconnected from repository changes until disaster strikes.
- **The Heimdall Solution**:
  - Full human-in-the-loop pair programming: you work alongside your agent fleet in real time.
  - Integrated file editor and native Git VCS diff viewer allow you to inspect, edit, and guide changes as they happen.
  - Low-latency interactive PTY terminal streaming (`ham-pty-host`) lets you jump into any agent's live shell session with zero latency.

## 6. Developer FAQ (`<section class="faq">`)

1. **What is Heimdall?**  
   Heimdall is an enterprise-grade multi-agent manager and orchestrator built with Odin. It coordinates teams of autonomous AI coding agents operating across multiple host environments with transaction-safe tasks, strict review gates, and zero-knowledge encryption.

2. **How does remote access work without SSH or VPN?**  
   Heimdall bridges initiate outbound TLS WebSocket connections to your Hub. Because connections are outbound, you can access your workstation or homelab agent fleet from anywhere without configuring firewall port-forwarding, dynamic DNS, or VPN clients like Tailscale.

3. **How does Heimdall protect my code and secrets?**  
   Heimdall uses a Zero-Knowledge Vault architecture. Your Master Password derives a 256-bit AES-GCM wrapping key entirely in your client browser/UI. All data that leaves your local device is encrypted ciphertext (`vault:v1:...`). The Hub never sees plaintext prompts, code, or API keys.

4. **Can I bring my own existing coding agents?**  
   Yes. Heimdall is completely harness-agnostic (BYOA). It seamlessly manages Antigravity, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor Agent, OpenCode, Aider, and custom agent runtimes through its universal PTY bridge (`ham-pty-host`).

5. **Can I work alongside my agents while they code?**  
   Yes. Heimdall includes a built-in code editor, native Git VCS diff viewer, and interactive PTY terminal streaming. You can review intermediate diffs, make manual edits, or jump into an agent's shell at any time.

6. **Does Heimdall require Docker or Kubernetes?**  
   No. Heimdall compiles to static native binaries with zero external runtime dependencies and runs as a lightweight user systemd unit (Linux) or launchd service (macOS) using ~20MB of RAM.

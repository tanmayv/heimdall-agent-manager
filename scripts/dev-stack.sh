# Local Heimdall dev stack: hub + dev-proxy + bridge + (optional) UI.
# Everything talks to the LOCAL hub (127.0.0.1:8081), never hub.mundus.in.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dev-stack.sh build      # build fresh nix binaries -> ./result-* symlinks
#   scripts/dev-stack.sh start      # repair bridge config, then start hub+proxy+bridge
#   scripts/dev-stack.sh enroll     # mint a fresh bridge token for this hub.db (fixes
#                                   # "bridge is offline" after a hub.db reset)
#   scripts/dev-stack.sh fix-config # rewrite bridge ham_ctl_bin/wrapper_bin to current
#                                   # build + strip [[peer]] blocks (start does this too)
#   scripts/dev-stack.sh stop       # stop local hub+proxy+bridge (NOT the mundus bridge)
#   scripts/dev-stack.sh status     # show what is running
#   scripts/dev-stack.sh ui         # run the Vite+Electron dev UI (foreground)
#
# Note: `start` always repairs the bridge config so it points at the CURRENT
# freshly-built ham-ctl/ham-wrapper. This avoids the classic trap where a pinned
# stale /nix/store ham-ctl lacks `agent start-success`, so launched agents run but
# get stuck at startup_failed.

# Ensure the bridge config has a bridge_token that this hub.db actually knows.
# If the current token fails the hub-runtime handshake, re-enroll to mint a fresh
# matching token and write it into the config. Idempotent.
# enroll drives the BROWSER-APPROVED DEVICE FLOW, which is the only enrollment there
# is (REQ-ENROLL-9). The one-time `hbe_` token and `POST /api/v1/bridges/enroll` are
# deleted, so the old two-step "mint a token, then exchange it" is gone.
#
# HOW THIS STAYS NON-INTERACTIVE WITHOUT WEAKENING ANYTHING. The device flow requires
# a human approval, and that is the point of it — but on this stack the dev-proxy
# already authenticates every request as the local user by injecting
# X-authentik-username. So the script can POST the approval itself: it is a real,
# authenticated approval by the local developer, made through the same endpoint and
# the same Auth_Context a browser would use. No test-only bypass exists in the Hub,
# and none is needed here.
#
# WHAT IS WRITTEN. The credential is now an EXPIRING PAIR: the access token goes to
# $BRIDGE_TOKEN_FILE and the refresh token to "$BRIDGE_TOKEN_FILE.refresh". The
# running bridge renews the access token on its own. The token is deliberately NOT
# folded into config.toml any more — see _fix_bridge_config.

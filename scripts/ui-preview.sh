#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ui-preview.sh — build the renderer and serve it in a ham-ctl shell session so a
# user can open the running UI from Heimdall's preview pane.
#
# What this gets you
# ------------------
# A real browser session against a REAL Hub API (not mocks, not fixtures): the
# bundle talks to `/api/v1/...`, which this preview forwards to a `ham-dev-proxy`,
# which is the trusted proxy in front of a running hub. Anything you click WRITES
# to that hub — point it at a throwaway or QA hub, never at production.
#
# Why a built bundle and not `vite dev`
# ------------------------------------
# A shell session is reachable only under a path prefix the app never sees:
#
#     http://127.0.0.1:<local_endpoint_port>/proxy/<session_id>/<path>
#
# The bridge strips that prefix before dialling the port, so the server sees plain
# paths — but the BROWSER does not, and any URL the page requests at an absolute
# path loses the prefix and 404s. A built bundle with `base: './'` emits relative
# asset URLs that inherit the prefix; `vite dev` emits absolute `/@vite/`, `/src/*`
# and an HMR socket URL that cannot. So: build, then serve.
#
# `/api/v1/...` is the one absolute path a build cannot make relative on its own —
# hence `VITE_API_BASE=.` (see src/ui/api/apiBase.ts). It is opt-in and build-time
# only: a plain `npm run build` sets nothing and emits the usual absolute paths.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ui-preview.sh                 # build + serve + verify
#   scripts/ui-preview.sh --no-build      # reuse the existing dist-preview
#   scripts/ui-preview.sh --stop          # kill the session this script started
#
# Env:
#   HEIMDALL_PREVIEW_UPSTREAM  ham-dev-proxy to forward /api/v1 to (default :8190)
#   HEIMDALL_PREVIEW_PORT      port the preview server binds       (default 45180)
#   HEIMDALL_PREVIEW_DIR       build output dir                    (default dist-preview)
#   HEIMDALL_PREVIEW_CHAIN     file the session under this task chain   (optional)
#   HEIMDALL_PREVIEW_PROJECT   file the session under this project      (optional)
#   HAM_CTL                    ham-ctl binary (default: $HEIMDALL_CTL_BIN, else PATH)

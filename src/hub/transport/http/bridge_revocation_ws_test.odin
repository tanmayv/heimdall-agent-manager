// REQ-IMPL-3 / audit finding F6: REVOCATION MUST TERMINATE AN IN-FLIGHT WEBSOCKET.
//
// WHY A REAL SOCKET AND A REAL BLOCKED READER, rather than asserting that a mock
// closer was invoked. F6 is precisely the class of bug where the bookkeeping is all
// correct and the connection stays up anyway: `revoke_bridge` already flipped
// `bridges.status` to revoked, and a reviewer reading that code would reasonably
// conclude the bridge was cut off. It was not. A test that asserts "the seam was
// called" re-creates exactly that mistake one layer up — it proves the Hub INTENDED
// to close the socket.
//
// So this test reproduces the production shape: a loopback TCP pair stands in for
// the bridge's control connection, the hub end is registered in the runtime registry
// the way bridge_ws_upgrade_handler registers it, and a second thread parks in a
// blocking read on it exactly as bridge_ws_runtime_loop does. The assertion is about
// the SOCKET: the parked read must return promptly because the connection was torn
// down, not at its own deadline.
//
// WHY THE DEADLINE NUMBERS ARE WHAT THEY ARE. Production parks with a 120s receive
// timeout; using that here would make a FAILING test hang for two minutes. The
// reader's own timeout is therefore 10s — long enough that returning inside it can
// only be a teardown and not the deadline — while the assertion window is 3s. A
// revocation that works returns in microseconds; the gap exists for a loaded CI box,
// not because any part of this is expected to take seconds.

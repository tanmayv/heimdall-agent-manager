// REQ-SHELL-29: screen snapshot on stream attach for LATE-JOINING viewers.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Both terminal consumers already understand a `screen` frame
// (useShellStream.ts:221, useAgentStream.ts:225) and feed its payload into the same
// sink as incremental output. What was missing is a producer for a viewer that joins a
// session ALREADY being watched.
//
// The pty-host does emit a catchup screen on Attach, and the bridge forwards it
// (pty_host_stream_worker.odin:149-156) — but only on the hub's 0->1 viewer transition
// (shell_session_service.odin:140), and it travels as `shell_pty_output`, which the hub
// BROADCASTS to every viewer. So it cannot serve viewer #2 without repainting viewer #1.
// That 0->1 path is deliberately left byte-exact here; this serves late joiners only.
//
// ORDERING (REQ-SHELL-29 AC3, as revised). The snapshot travels the command/reply
// channel while incremental output is a bridge->hub push, so the two have NO
// protocol-level ordering. Rather than pretend otherwise, the payload is prefixed with
// erase-screen + cursor-home, making it an ABSOLUTE REPAINT: it discards whatever the
// client already drew, so DUPLICATION IS STRUCTURALLY IMPOSSIBLE.
//
// The residual, stated precisely: output produced between the pty-host's capture and the
// reply landing (one bridge->hub hop) is painted over and does not reappear until the
// program next writes. This is NOT a no-loss guarantee and must not be described as one.
// For the case that motivates the task — switching back to an idle shell sitting at a
// prompt — no output is in flight, so the repaint is exact.

// _shell_screen_lf_to_crlf rewrites the pane's bare row separators into CRLF.
// Caller owns the result.
//
// WHY THIS IS NEEDED (REQ-SHELL-30). The pane text arrives as one string PER GRID ROW joined
// with a bare LF — bridge_pty_host_screen_to_output in src/bridge/pty_host_runtime.odin. A VT
// drops one row on LF and KEEPS the column, so the repaint drew every row starting where the
// previous one ended — a diagonal staircase on a viewer's FIRST render.
//
// WHY THE POLLED PANE IS SAFE ON THE SAME TEXT — CORRECTED BY REQ-SHELL-31. This comment used
// to say the polling pane "paints into the DOM, where bare LF is correct". THAT IS FALSE: the
// poller writes into xterm too (ShellTerminalPane.tsx:300 and :333,
// `term.write('\x1b[?25l' + output)`, fed by REST GET /shells/{id}/pane, which returns the
// bridge reply verbatim). Both paths feed a terminal. The poller is safe because xterm's OWN
// `convertEol` option performs the LF->CRLF conversion, and the code deliberately turns it OFF
// while streaming: `convertEol: !isStreamingActive` (ShellTerminalPane.tsx:229, kept in sync at
// :349; AgentPaneComposerPanel.tsx:263/:390 is the identical pair).
//
// The invariant is therefore about convertEol, NOT about "terminal vs DOM": the bare-LF text is
// safe in any consumer with convertEol ON and unsafe exactly where it is OFF. Anyone auditing
// for further instances should grep for the streaming paths / convertEol:false. The original
// framing sent two agents hunting for a non-terminal consumer that does not exist, and it missed
// the bridge's own catch-up emit (pty_host_stream_worker.odin), which REQ-SHELL-31 then had to
// fix as the SECOND staircase producer.
//
// WHY THE FIX LIVES HERE AND NOT AT THE JOIN. bridge_pty_host_screen_to_output is also the input
// to bridge_pty_host_pane_hash (the very next statement in bridge_pty_host_evaluate_pane), so
// changing the join would not merely alter the poller's text — it would invalidate every stored
// since_hash at once and cost every client a full repaint. This builder is the WS/terminal-only
// seam, and it is already the thing that speaks VT: it prepends erase-screen + cursor-home.
//
// An LF that ALREADY has a CR in front of it is passed through untouched, so this can never
// produce "\r\r\n" should a pane source ever start sending CRLF itself.
//
// NOTHING here measures width. vt.rs capture() writes SGR runs INLINE into each row, so a row's
// byte length is not its display width and must never be used as one. The separator is decided
// per LF byte, never per length.

// _shell_stream_write_screen_frame turns a pane reply into one or more `screen` frames on
// ONE socket. An empty `output` writes nothing: a terminal session answers locally with
// output:"" and has no screen worth repainting.
//
// WHY THIS CHUNKS (REQ-SHELL-33). This is the one caller on this socket whose payload can
// exceed a WebSocket length arm: vt.rs's capture() writes SGR colour runs INLINE into every
// row, so a wide, fully-coloured pane produces a repaint far larger than its display area.
// Before this change that frame was silently dropped and the viewer saw a BLANK PANE —
// exactly the late-join repaint REQ-SHELL-29 exists to provide, failing where it matters
// most. A 64-bit length arm alone would not settle it: any cap, however generous, would
// turn the same case back into a blank pane, only with a log line. Cutting the repaint into
// ordered frames means a snapshot of ANY size paints.
//
// This is sound because the repaint is ABSOLUTE and SEQUENTIAL. The erase+home prefix leads
// the first chunk only; the rest continue where it left off, on the same socket, written in
// order by this proc, into a client that feeds every `screen` frame to the same terminal
// sink. Re-prefixing later chunks would erase the part already painted.
//
// ATOMICITY, not merely ordering. Chunking is only sound if NOTHING ELSE writes this
// socket mid-sequence. It is not enough that the chunks leave in order: the bridge-push
// path (shell_session_broadcast_output) writes the same viewer socket from another thread,
// and an `output` frame between two chunks moves the cursor, after which every remaining
// chunk — none of which carries erase+home or absolute positioning — paints from the wrong
// place. The whole sequence is therefore written under that session's viewer-write lock;
// see shell_session_viewer_write_lock for why the lock is per session and why concurrent
// writes were in fact never safe on this socket even at one frame each.
//
// A partial paint on a mid-sequence failure is deliberate and is not a regression: the
// alternative is the blank pane this replaces, and the next output or snapshot repaints
// absolutely.
// `sessions`/`stream_id` name the viewer-write lock this sequence must hold — see the
// ATOMICITY note above. They may be nil/"" only where there is no fan-out to race with,
// which in practice means tests; production callers always have both.

// shell_stream_should_send_screen_snapshot decides whether an attaching viewer's resize
// frame must be answered with a screen snapshot. It is THE gate: both stream handlers
// (shell_session_handlers.odin, agent_instance_handlers.odin) consult it rather than
// spelling the condition out twice, so the two panes cannot drift apart again.
//
// REQ-SHELL-61 — `late_join` IS ACCEPTED AND DELIBERATELY NOT CONSULTED, and that is the
// whole fix. This gate used to read `late_join && !screen_sent`, which meant THE FIRST
// VIEWER OF A SESSION NEVER RECEIVED A SNAPSHOT. Viewer #1 was expected to be painted by
// the pty-host's catch-up that the bridge forwards on the hub's 0->1 transition; when that
// catch-up carries little or nothing, viewer #1 gets a BLANK PANE, which is the reported
// neovim defect. A re-render or a tab switch appeared to "fix" it only because it made the
// viewer a late joiner, where the snapshot did fire.
//
// WHY SERVING VIEWER #1 TOO IS SAFE, since the design note at the top of this file is easy
// to misread as an argument against it. That note explains why the 0->1 catch-up cannot
// serve viewer #2 — it travels as `shell_pty_output`, which the hub BROADCASTS, so it would
// repaint viewer #1. That is an argument for ADDING a targeted snapshot for late joiners.
// It is not an argument for WITHHOLDING one from viewer #1, and the code never had one:
//   - the snapshot is a TARGETED write. shell_stream_send_shell_screen_snapshot is handed
//     one `client` socket and _shell_stream_write_screen_frame writes only that socket —
//     no fan-out, no viewer-list iteration — so it cannot repaint anybody else;
//   - it is an ABSOLUTE REPAINT (SHELL_SCREEN_REPAINT_PREFIX, erase-screen + cursor-home),
//     so viewer #1 receiving BOTH the catch-up and the snapshot paints over, it does not
//     duplicate. The cost is one extra pane capture per attach.
//
// `screen_sent` keeps it once-per-stream: a viewer resizes repeatedly and only the first
// resize earns a capture.
//
// THE GEOMETRY GUARD IS PART OF THE GATE, not an incidental caller-side check, because it
// is a live trap worth seeing in one place: a snapshot is only ever produced from a resize
// frame carrying real geometry (capturing at a guessed 80 columns would re-wrap the
// screen), so a client that sends NO resize, or sends 0/0, gets no snapshot at all. Since
// REQ-SHELL-61 that also means it gets no screen on a first attach beyond whatever the
// catch-up drew. The shells UI does always send one from inside `onopen`
// (useShellStream.ts sendGeometry -> shellStreamFrames.ts shellResizeFrame), with 24x80
// floors applied in ShellTerminalPane.tsx getGeometry — but that helper returns null when
// the xterm instance does not exist yet, and a null frame is silently not sent.

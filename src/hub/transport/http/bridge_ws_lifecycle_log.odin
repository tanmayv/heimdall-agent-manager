// REQ-SHELL-41: BRIDGE CONNECTION LIFECYCLE OBSERVABILITY.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Before it, the hub emitted NOTHING about a bridge command
// socket connecting or going away: bridge_ws_upgrade_handler logged only kill-replay
// shortfalls, bridge_ws_disconnect had no print at all, and the runtime loop's
// `if !ok do return` was silent. So "did this bridge reconnect, when, and why" was
// unanswerable from the logs, which is exactly the step REQ-SHELL-32 could not confirm
// and had to ship as "source-derived, not observed".
//
// CONNECTION LIFECYCLE ONLY — NEVER PER-FRAME. The bridge command socket carries PTY
// output frames at roughly 11KB on a 25ms cadence; a log line per frame would itself be
// a defect (and is forbidden by this task's AC3). Everything here fires at most twice
// per TCP connection: once on connect, once on teardown.

// Bridge_WS_Disconnect_Reason names WHY a bridge command-socket connection ended.
//
// THIS TYPE EXISTS BECAUSE THE REASON USED TO BE DESTROYED BEFORE ANY CALLER COULD SEE
// IT. read_ws_text_blocking returned a bare `bool`, and three genuinely different
// outcomes — a fatal/desynced frame, a read-deadline expiry, and a clean peer close —
// all collapsed into the same `false`. No amount of logging at the teardown site could
// have told them apart, so the reason had to be plumbed out of the reader first.
Bridge_WS_Disconnect_Reason :: enum {
	// Not a teardown: the read produced a frame.
	None,
	// The peer sent a WS close frame (opcode 0x8), or the TCP stream reached a
	// graceful FIN (recv returned `0, nil`). An orderly shutdown either way.
	Clean_Close,
	// No frame arrived within the read deadline (120s on the runtime loop, 3s on the
	// hello). The bridge's idle heartbeat cadence is 45s, so this means roughly two
	// missed beats, not a merely slow bridge.
	Read_Deadline,
	// READER DESYNC. An unexpected non-text opcode, or a 64-bit (127) payload length,
	// which this control channel never legitimately uses. The stream cannot be
	// resynchronised, so the connection ends. This is the case that REQ-SHELL-32
	// needed to observe and could not.
	Fatal_Frame,
	// A socket-level receive error that is not a deadline and not a clean close
	// (ECONNRESET and friends).
	Recv_Error,
	// A NEWER connection for this same bridge took over while this one was still in
	// its read loop; this one is being retired in favour of it. Distinguished because
	// it is normal during a bridge restart and alarming at any other time.
	Connection_Replaced,
	// The frame was read and parsed but its application-level dispatch refused it and
	// asked for teardown.
	Frame_Rejected,
	// A write to the command socket failed, so the connection is torn down from the
	// write side rather than the read side.
	//
	// UNREACHABLE TODAY, AND DELIBERATELY KEPT AS A NAMED GAP. This task's description
	// asked for a write-failure/send-deadline reason as one of four cases "that already
	// exist in code as distinct outcomes". It does not: EVERY write to the bridge
	// command socket discards its result (`_ = write_ws_text_frame_locked(...)` at
	// bridge_handlers.odin:1204, :1564, :1655 and :1692), so no write failure has ever
	// torn down a bridge connection and nothing can currently set this reason. Making
	// one do so is a BEHAVIOUR change — a transient write failure would start killing
	// bridge connections — not an observability one, so it is out of this task's scope.
	//
	// It is kept rather than deleted so the gap is visible in the type itself. It must
	// NOT be wired to anything that merely *looks* like a write failure: a reason that
	// can never fire, read as "no writes were abandoned", is precisely the
	// always-zero-counter trap that ws.send_timeouts() set for this chain.
	Write_Failed,

// MECHANISM: a per-bridge rolling window that logs the first
// BRIDGE_WS_LOG_BURST connect/disconnect PAIRS in any BRIDGE_WS_LOG_WINDOW and then
// goes quiet, counting what it suppressed. The next event after the window rolls over
// reports the suppressed total, so a flapping bridge costs a bounded handful of lines
// per minute and the flapping is still VISIBLE (you see "suppressed=N") rather than
// silently dropped — the whole point of this task is not to trade one blind spot for
// another.
//
// NO ALLOCATION ANYWHERE IN THIS TABLE, BY CONSTRUCTION (AC4). It is a fixed array of
// slots, and each slot stores the bridge id in an inline byte buffer rather than a
// cloned string. A map keyed by a cloned bridge_id would have been the idiomatic
// choice, and would also have been a permanent leak on a persistent background loop:
// this codebase has a documented history of exactly that (a [dynamic] global binding
// context.allocator in a background loop). A fixed table cannot leak because it never
// owns heap memory.

// ODIN_TEST_THREADS=1 that is harmless because nothing runs concurrently, and the package
// was green. At THREADS>1 one test's clear lands mid-loop inside another's, its slot
// vanishes, the next admit allocates a fresh slot with logged = 1, and the budget
// restarts. The signature is that `allowed` comes back as an exact multiple of
// BRIDGE_WS_LOG_BURST — 10 and 15 were both observed against an expected 5, i.e. one and
// two interfering clears. Giving each test a private limiter removes the sharing outright,

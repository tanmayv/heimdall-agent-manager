// REQ-SHELL-54: the preview/tunnel chunk is 48 KiB of RAW bytes, which base64s to
// exactly 65536 characters against a 65535-byte single-frame cap — over by ONE BYTE
// before the JSON wrapper is counted at all.
//
// WHAT WENT WRONG, and why the symptom pointed at the wrong component. Both tunnel
// senders slice the payload at CHUNK_SIZE :: 48 * 1024 and base64 each slice:
//
//     bridge_proxy_relay.odin:409      bridge_proxy_send_tunnel_bytes
//     shell_session_handlers.odin:418  the preview request path
//
// 49152 is divisible by 3, so base64 adds NO padding and the encoding is exactly
// ceil(49152/3)*4 = 65536 chars. _preview_tunnel_data_json then wraps it in ~60 more
// bytes plus the stream_id. Before REQ-SHELL-36 the resulting ~65.6 KiB command was
// handed to a writer that could only emit a 16-bit length, so it was refused, and the
// refusal was reported as Bridge_Offline. A FULL chunk therefore always failed while a
// short final chunk always succeeded: a size cliff at 48 KiB that blamed a healthy
// bridge.
//
// WHAT THESE TESTS ARE FOR. REQ-SHELL-36 made write_ws_command chunk any oversized
// command, and it gates on LENGTH ALONE — nothing keys off the command's "type" — so
// the tunnel frames are carried without either call site being touched. That is the
// claim, and a plausible mechanism is not an observation, so it is asserted here
// against the REAL frame the preview path emits and the REAL writer, over a real
// socket, with the bytes read back off the wire.
//
// THE VERIFICATION BOUNDARY, stated rather than implied. These tests cover the HUB
// half: the frame is built by the production wrapper builder, split by the production
// writer, and the wire bytes are reassembled here to prove nothing was lost. They do
// NOT execute the bridge's reassembler: src/bridge is `package main` and cannot be
// imported. That half is pinned by its own package's tests
// (src/bridge/hub_command_reassembly_test.odin, which includes an interop test for
// this exact emitter's frame shape), and the bridge dispatches on
// hub_command_frame_is_chunk for EVERY inbound frame, so it is no more tunnel-specific
// than the writer is.

//
// The invariant rests on two facts that are checked by CONSTRUCTION elsewhere and driven
// here:
//   1. write_ws_command is the ONLY route to the bridge command socket. The socket is
//      fetched at exactly two places, bridge_runtime.odin:18 (send_runtime_command) and

//   2. write_ws_text_frame -- the writer that can emit an over-cap frame -- has exactly
//      two callers, bridge_runtime.odin:210 and :231, and BOTH are inside
//      write_ws_command, on opposite sides of its size gate.
// So there is no path that reaches the wire around the gate. What remains to be shown is
// that the gate itself never lets an over-cap frame through, at ANY input size, which is
// what this test drives.

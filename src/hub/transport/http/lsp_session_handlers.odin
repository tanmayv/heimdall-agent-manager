// REQ-LSP-RLY-1: Hub WS relay for LSP sessions.
//
// Carries JSON-RPC between the browser and the bridge's LSP session
// (src/bridge/lsp_session.odin, REQ-LSP-BR-1). Modelled on
// shell_session_stream_handler in shell_session_handlers.odin — same ticket auth,
// same upgrade, same relay shape — with three deliberate differences, each decided
// by the coordinator on the task and recorded here so the next reader does not
// "fix" them back:
//
//  1. NO PERSISTED SESSION. A shell session is a row in shell_sessions and the
//     shell handler checks ownership by reading it. An LSP session has no table and
//     no migration: it is bound to a live socket AND a live process in the bridge's
//     own in-memory map, so a row would outlive both and need reaper logic. You
//     reattach to a terminal; you do not reattach to a language server. The socket
//     dying is the session ending.
//  2. OWNERSHIP IS STRUCTURAL, NOT A CHECK. The registry is keyed by
//     (owner_user_id, session_id), so two users who pick the same session id string
//     occupy different entries and cannot reach each other's. There is no
//     owner_user_id comparison to forget. The URL segment is therefore a plain
//     client-supplied id and needs no unguessability — it is namespaced by the
//     authenticated user.
//  3. START PARAMETERS ARRIVE AS A FRAME, NOT QUERY PARAMS. The browser sends
//     {"type":"start","bridge_id":..,"language":..,"file_path":..} after the
//     upgrade. THE BROWSER NEVER SUPPLIES cmd OR args: the Hub resolves those from
//     the operator's stored config (REQ-LSP-CFG-1). A browser-supplied cmd would be
//     arbitrary code execution on the bridge host, which is the security boundary
//     of this whole feature. file_path also changes as the user opens files, and a
//     query param would fix it at connect time and force a reconnect per file.

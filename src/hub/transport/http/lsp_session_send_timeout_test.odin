// REQ-LSP-RLY-2: a wedged browser must not be able to hold the LSP registry lock,
// and must never be left with half a frame on the wire.
//
// These tests run against a REAL loopback socket whose peer never reads, because
// that is the only way to actually fill a kernel send buffer and make net.send_tcp
// block — the defect is invisible to any test that uses a draining peer.
//
// They are deliberately NOT in lsp_session_socket_test.odin: its helpers are
// file-private, and this ticket's tests need a peer that is never drained, which is
// the opposite of what those helpers set up.

// Unit tests for the ephemeral "agent_action" activity-bubble frame.
// agent_action_event_json is the pure builder behind publish_agent_action, so
// these lock the wire payload shape (type/instance_id/action/summary/ts) and the
// id-free + rune-safe-clip contract WITHOUT a live event bus. The owner-scoped
// fanout in publish_agent_action reuses events.publish_raw_to_user (covered by the
// event-bus + existing publish helpers).

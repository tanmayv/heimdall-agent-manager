// Bridge_Token is one credential in a bridge's rotation lineage (REQ-IMPL-3,
// design §7.2/§7.4). Two rows exist per generation — one `.Access`, one
// `.Refresh` — and every generation of one enrollment shares a family_id.
//
// WHAT EACH FIELD IS FOR, since three of them look redundant and are not:
//
//   expires_at         — this ROW's expiry. Access: issued_at + 1h. Refresh:
//                        issued_at + 30d, re-based on every rotation (§7.4.5's
//                        sliding window).
//   family_expires_at  — the ABSOLUTE cap on the lineage, copied forward
//                        unchanged through every rotation. Sliding expiry alone
//                        means a refresh token that is used often never expires;
//                        this is what eventually forces re-enrollment. Carried on
//                        every row rather than in a family table so the verify
//                        path reads it from the row it already fetched.
//   rotated_at         — non-empty means this refresh token WAS SPENT. It is not
//                        a soft-delete: the row has to outlive its own
//                        replacement, because presenting a spent refresh token is
//                        the theft signal that revokes the whole family (§7.4.3).
//                        A rotated row that were deleted instead would make the
//                        replay indistinguishable from an unknown token.
//
// token_id is PUBLIC: it is the lookup half of `<prefix><token_id>.<secret>`
// (settled 6), and only token_hash's secret is confidential.

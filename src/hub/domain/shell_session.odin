// Shell_Session is the hub-side record for a bridge-managed shell session.
// Replaces Shell_Job as the unified session concept per REQ-SH-CONTRACT §1.
//
// REQ-SHELL-1 collapsed the model to exactly THREE kinds, sharing ONE lifecycle:
//
//   run    — a one-shot command with captured stdout. Agent-triggered only.
//   shell  — an interactive PTY. User only; no stdout capture, it is a terminal.
//   server — a long-running process with stdout and an optional exposable port.
//
// The former `agent` kind is GONE, not renamed. It only ever meant "key the
// pty-host daemon by agent_instance_id instead of session_id", and agent
// terminal panes are served by a different mechanism entirely
// (capture_agent_pane / get_agent_pane in src/bridge/hub_runtime_client.odin),
// so nothing consumed it. `command` became `run` and `interactive` became
// `shell` as HARD renames — there is no back-compat requirement here, so there
// are deliberately no alias values and no dual-accept parsing. Migration
// 048_shell_sessions_kind_and_key.sql rewrites the stored rows.

// Scope governs ownership, listing and visibility, and it differs per kind:
//
//   run    — AGENT scoped.            Keyed by agent_instance_id.
//   server — TASK CHAIN + BRIDGE.     Keyed by chain_id AND bridge_id.
//   shell  — BRIDGE scoped.           Keyed by bridge_id alone.
//
// This is ONE definition, in the same spirit as SHELL_SESSION_TERMINAL_STATUSES
// below: the service validates against it, the repository builds its list
// filters from it, and the handlers do neither of those themselves. Do not
// re-express a scope rule anywhere else — a second spelling is exactly the drift
// the terminal-status table exists to prevent.

//               legitimately return this kind.

//               than filled with noise, and a list narrowed by one of them must
//               never return this kind.
//
// bridge_id is deliberately absent from `forbidden` everywhere: every session
// physically lives on a bridge and (bridge_id, session_id) is the table's

// SCOPE key — which is why it is in neither set for that kind.

//   shell  — USER ONLY. It is an interactive terminal; an agent has no terminal
//            to type into.
//   server — EITHER. Explicitly "do not build an agent-only variant".
//
// This is AUTHORIZATION and is deliberately NOT part of the scope rules, which

// back the session id in the same shape a --bg start would have. If background

//
// The scope of each cap follows the kind's own scope rule rather than being

//
//   OBSERVED   — a bridge reported the exit. The bridge waited on the child, so it
//                knows the process is gone and knows its exit code. This is
//                knowledge.
//   SYNTHESIZED — the hub concluded the process must be gone without seeing it end:
//                shell_session_create's failure path, and (REQ-SHELL-14) the sweep
//                that lands a terminal status on the sessions of a bridge that is
//                never coming back. This is a well-founded guess.
//
// REQ-SHELL-4 needs the distinction because the two orderings are not symmetric. A
// bridge that was written off and then returns with the real exit must be allowed to
// correct the guess — otherwise a synthesized status permanently outranks ground
// truth, and the session keeps a fabricated exit_code forever. The reverse is never
// allowed: a guess must not overwrite an observation.
//
// EXIT_CODE_SET IS THE DISCRIMINATOR, and it is reused rather than duplicated with a
// new provenance column because it already carries exactly this meaning: every
// bridge-reported exit sets it (all three bridge_shell_exited_event_json call sites
// pass exit_code_set=true — bridge_shell_session.odin:1113, :1192,
// pty_host_runtime.odin:616), and no hub-synthesized terminal can set it, because
// the hub has no exit code to record. An observed exit is precisely one that came
// with an observed code.
//
// THE CONDITION ON THAT REUSE, which REQ-SHELL-14 must honour: a synthesized
// terminal status must NOT invent an exit_code_set=true. The moment a hub-side path
// stamps a fabricated exit code, this predicate silently starts calling a guess an
// observation, and the supersession above stops working with no test failing. If
// REQ-SHELL-14 needs to record a code it did not observe, this predicate must move

package main

// Shared bridge-provisioning helper for this package's tests (REQ-ENROLL-9).
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Before REQ-IMPL-6, every test here that needed a bridge
// open-coded the same two requests: POST /api/v1/bridge-enrollments for a one-time
// token, then POST /api/v1/bridges/enroll to exchange it. Both endpoints are
// deleted. The tests themselves are not about enrollment — they need a bridge and a
// credential so they can exercise shells, resize, input, LSP config and title
// events — so the provisioning was migrated here rather than the tests dropped.
//
// It drives the PRODUCTION device-flow endpoints rather than calling the service,
// so every suite that uses it now covers the real enrollment path as a side effect.
//
// THE THREE NON-OBVIOUS REQUIREMENTS, each of which rejects a request outright:
//
//  1. `bridge_public_key` must be a 130-char lowercase-hex uncompressed P-256
//     point. A short placeholder is refused at the HTTP layer (the service layer
//     only checks non-empty, which is why direct-service fixtures can use one).
//  2. NO `bridge_key_fingerprint` is sent. The Hub derives it from the key and
//     refuses a body-supplied one that disagrees — a requester-chosen fingerprint
//     would defeat the human comparing it on the approval screen.
//  3. PKCE is MANDATORY for a bridge grant and S256-only: `plain` and a missing
//     method are both refused. The pair below is precomputed, so this helper needs
//     no crypto, and the verifier is replayed at the token call.
//
// `device_label` becomes the bridge's machine_hostname and therefore its label, so
// callers that assert on a bridge label pass it as the label.

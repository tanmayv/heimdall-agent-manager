// REQ-CONN-1: open() must NUL-terminate the path before handing it to SQLite.
// Odin strings carry a pointer + length and are not NUL-terminated, so a runtime-built
// path (main.odin builds database_path with strings.clone(os.args[i+1])) has no
// terminator. A literal path is NUL-terminated in the binary and would pass either way,
// so every path below is constructed at runtime.

// Heap-allocated, exactly len bytes — the shape main.odin produces.

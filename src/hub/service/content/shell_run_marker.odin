// REQ-SHELL-5 §2, §3, §4 — the LEAN `shell_run` marker.
//
// A run gets exactly ONE chat message, written at creation, in the conversation of
// whoever triggered it. It is a MARKER, not a report: it names the session and
// nothing else, and the UI resolves the command, the status, the exit code and the
// output live from the session row (and, for output, from the bridge on demand —
// output never reaches this database, see shell_session_get_log).
//
// WHY IT CARRIES NO STATUS, which is the whole design and is easy to undo by
// accident. Status is not in the message because a message that carried status would
// have to be EDITED every time the run changed state, and a run that was later
// converted to background would be indistinguishable from one that was started that
// way. With status left out:
//
//   - the marker is written once and never touched again (REQ-SHELL-5 §4);
//   - a foreground run converted to background mid-flight still has exactly ONE
//     message, because the conversion writes no message at all;
//   - the UI's "pin it above the composer while it is live, collapse it once it is
//     not" is a pure rendering decision off the live row (REQ-SHELL-6 item 2), with
//     no transcript rewrite behind it.
//
// Adding a status, an exit code, output, or the command text to this message breaks
// all three at once. Don't.
//
// THE SHAPE FOLLOWS `pane_capture` (request_pane_capture in content_service.odin),
// which is the established precedent in this codebase for a message the UI renders
// specially rather than as prose: a message_type the renderer switches on, a
// metadata_json carrying the ids it needs, and a short human-readable body for the
// conversation preview and for any client that does not know the type.

// SHELL_RUN_MESSAGE_TYPE is the message_type the UI switches on, alongside
// "pane_capture". The column already exists — migration 017_chat_message_types.sql
// added message_type/message_status/metadata_json — so this needs no migration.
SHELL_RUN_MESSAGE_TYPE :: "shell_run"

// SHELL_RUN_MARKER_BODY is the body every marker carries, verbatim.
//
// It is a FIXED string and deliberately not the session id, even though the id is the
// only thing this message is about. metadata_json is the id's carrier (REQ-SHELL-5 §3
// says it carries only the session id); spelling it into the body as well would make
// two fields that must agree forever, which is the duplication this package's comments
// keep warning about. The body exists for the conversation preview and for a client
// that does not know the type, so it reads as a label rather than as an identifier.
SHELL_RUN_MARKER_BODY :: "Shell run"

// record_shell_run_marker writes the single `shell_run` marker for a run.
//
// CONVERSATION SCOPE (REQ-SHELL-5 §2): the marker goes to the ONE conversation named
// by the caller and nowhere else. There is deliberately no chain-wide or user-wide
// fan-out here — not a filtered one, not a second write. A run belongs to the agent
// that triggered it; a server's chain-wide visibility is a different kind with a
// different surface (the chain summary, REQ-SHELL-6).
//
// The caller is the shell_session service, which has already resolved and validated
// the conversation from the agent's own instance rather than from anything the client
// asked for — so this takes a conversation_id it can trust and does not re-derive it.
// It still checks that the conversation exists and that the run's agent owns it,
// because a marker written into somebody else's conversation is exactly the failure
// REQ-SHELL-5 AC5 asks to be impossible, and one guard at the write is cheap.
//
// Returns the saved message and whether it was written. A missing conversation is NOT
// an error worth failing a run over — the run is already spawned and healthy by the
// time this is called — so it reports false and the caller carries on.

	//   heap-allocating and NOT freeing it — which is what request_pane_capture does,
	//   and what this proc did first — is a real per-run leak. The precedent is worth
	//   following for the message SHAPE, not for its allocation.
	//
	// The temp arena is reclaimed per request, and the value is consumed within this
	// request: the sqlite repository copies it when it binds the statement. This is the

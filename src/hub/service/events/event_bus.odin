// _publish_write_removes_socket answers the only question the fan-out loop asks: is
// this CONNECTION finished? REQ-SHELL-35.
//
// The bug this replaces was a single `if !write_ws_text_frame(...)`. A bool cannot
// distinguish "the hub could not encode this frame" from "the peer is gone", and the
// fan-out loop read every falsey return as the latter — so one oversized event did not
// drop one event, it called user_ws_remove and PERMANENTLY unsubscribed a live, healthy
// browser from EVERY FUTURE EVENT. That client then had no way to find out: REQ-SHELL-6
// §6 deleted the UI's pollers, so it does not error, does not reconnect and does not show
// a disconnected state — it silently stops repainting and is indistinguishable from an
// idle app. The hub believes it has no such subscriber while the browser believes it is
// subscribed, which is precisely the convergence violation this chain exists to prevent.
//
// .Too_Large therefore KEEPS the slot: not one byte of that frame was written, so it says
// nothing whatever about the socket. .Desynchronised DOES remove it — half a frame is
// already on the wire and that client will misparse every byte after it, so ending a
// corrupt stream is the recovery, not the failure. That case is worse than an oversized
// drop and the old code could not even see it: `_, err := net.send_tcp(...)` discarded the
// written count, so a partial write reported plain success-or-failure.
//
// This mirrors _viewer_write_ends_session in the shell session service, deliberately: a
// client must not have to learn two different rules for when the hub gives up on it.

//   .Desynchronised the client IS dropped, but dropping it is the recovery; the fact worth
//                   reporting is that the hub put half a frame on the wire.
//
// .Peer_Gone is deliberately silent: a browser closing a tab is ordinary, and logging it
// would bury the two lines above in noise.
//
// The counters live at the CALL SITE rather than in here, so that the outcomes of a fan-out
// write are incremented in one place and this proc does only what its name says.

// HOW BIG CAN AN EVENT ACTUALLY GET, AND WHY THAT QUESTION HAS TO STAY ANSWERED HERE.
//
// REQ-SHELL-35 asked it, because the old 65535-byte cliff was fatal and the answer decides
// whether it was an everyday occurrence or a rare one. Every publisher into this bus was
// enumerated and read; the result, so nobody has to redo it:
//
//   BOUNDED, and bounded for a REASON rather than by luck:
//     - the agent->user chat event carries a 140-RUNE PREVIEW plus fetch_required:true, not
//       the body, so an arbitrarily long chat message yields a ~400-byte event;
//     - task / chain / shell_session / bridge events carry IDS and a status, never a
//       description or a body — a multi-KB chain description never enters an event;
//     - the activity-bubble summary is rune-clipped at the call site;
//     - messages_read carries an id array whose producer caps the list at 200 rows.
//
//   UNBOUNDED, today, one field: agent_instance_summary_json embeds display_name verbatim,
//   and display_name is client-supplied, trimmed and stored with NO LENGTH CAP. It rides
//   every created and status_changed event for that instance, and JSON escaping inflates
//   control bytes sixfold. That is the path that could actually cross the old cliff.
//
// So the size of an event is DATA-DRIVEN and bounded only by how each summary happens to
// be written today. That is why the fix is not "cap the summaries": a 65535 bound spread
// across ~30 call sites is a trap, and the one that matters is that crossing it must cost
// a repaint rather than the client's entire event feed.
//
// WHERE AC2 LANDS — DELIVERY, not a survivable drop. With the 64-bit arm every event up to
// ws.WS_MAX_SERVER_PAYLOAD (16 MiB) is really sent, so nothing above is at risk any more;
// the largest thing enumerated is ~5 KB. Above 16 MiB an event IS still dropped, with the
// socket kept, counted and logged, and that residual is deliberate: the frame is built in
// one contiguous allocation, so removing the bound would make a remote-supplied string an
// unbounded hub-side allocation. Chunking is not the answer either — this bus has no
// sequencing, and the UI refetches authoritative state from the id in the event.

// write_ws_text_frame writes one text frame to a user (BROWSER) socket. REQ-SHELL-35

//
// allow_64bit IS TRUE HERE, AND THAT IS A PROPERTY OF THIS REGISTRY, NOT A DEFAULT. Every
// socket on this bus arrives through user_ws_add, whose only caller is the /user WebSocket
// upgrade — so every peer is a browser, and a browser parses a 127 length correctly. The
// bridge command channel takes the OPPOSITE answer for the same reason reversed: our own
// readers treat a 127 length as fatal, so emitting one toward a bridge would turn a dropped
// frame into a killed connection. See the note on ws.write_server_text.
//
// This wrapper exists for the one caller that sends a FIXED-SHAPE control frame — the
// user_ws_ready handshake — for which Too_Large would mean a bug in this repository rather
// than a large event, and which can do nothing different about the reason. The fan-out path
// does NOT use it: publish_raw_to_user needs the typed result, because acting on the
// difference is the fix.

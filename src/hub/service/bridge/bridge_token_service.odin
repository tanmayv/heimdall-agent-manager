// Expiring bridge credentials: issue, verify, rotate, revoke (REQ-IMPL-3,
// REQ-ENROLL-13, design §7.2/§7.4/§7.5).
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES. Audit finding F3: the `hbr_` bridge token never expired and
// never rotated, so a credential read once from a disk or a database was good
// forever. A device-enrolled bridge now receives a PAIR:
//
//   hba_<token_id>.<secret>   access   1 hour,  presented on every WS connect / API call
//   hbf_<token_id>.<secret>   refresh  30 days sliding, presented ONLY to the refresh
//                                      endpoint, single-use, rotated on every use
//
// Both are minted by `issue_credential` (REQ-IMPL-1, settled 7) — 256-bit CSPRNG
// secret, stored as `sha256:v1:<salt>:<digest>`, verified with a constant-time
// compare over the whole stored string. Nothing here derives a secret from
// `platform.generate_id`, which is prefix + unix-nanoseconds; `generate_id` is used
// only for the non-secret `btk_` row id and `bfam_` family id.
//
// THE THREE PROPERTIES THIS FILE EXISTS TO HOLD, each with a test named after it:
//
//  1. EXPIRY IS ENFORCED ON THE VALIDATION PATH, not merely recorded. An `hba_`
//     past its expiry authenticates nothing, whatever the bridge row says.
//  2. ROTATION IS SINGLE-USE AND REUSE IS TREATED AS THEFT. Presenting a refresh
//     token that was already spent revokes the ENTIRE FAMILY — every generation,
//     both kinds — and forces re-enrollment (§7.4.3). This is the control that
//     turns refresh-token theft from silent persistent access into a loud,
//     self-limiting event, and it is the reason a spent row is kept rather than
//     deleted: a deleted row makes a replay look like an unknown token.
//  3. THE EXISTENCE ORACLE STAYS SHUT TO THE SAME DEGREE REQ-IMPL-1 LEFT IT.
//     Every lookup miss on this path burns the same salted hash and constant-time
//     compare a hit would, via `verify_credential_miss`, and returns the identical
//     error. Settled 6. Read verify_credential_miss's own header before changing
//     any miss path here — the protection is conditional on that proc allocating.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DEFEND AGAINST, stated plainly because REQ-ENROLL-8 requires it
// and because the narrower claim is the honest one:
//   - The DATABASE HALF of the existence oracle. A miss skips a successful SQLite
//     fetch and column decode that a hit performs, which is plausibly a larger
//     timing signal than the hash this equalises. A local attacker with timing
//     precision may still distinguish a known `token_id` from an unknown one. The
//     oracle is NARROWED, NOT CLOSED, exactly as REQ-IMPL-1 left it.
//   - A STOLEN ACCESS TOKEN inside its hour. Expiry bounds the damage; it does not
//     detect the theft. Only the refresh token's rotation does that.
//   - A SAME-UID COMPROMISE of the bridge host, which reads both tokens from memory
//     or the keyring (threat T1).

// ACCESS/REFRESH prefixes. Distinct prefixes are not cosmetic: they are what makes
// "a refresh token presented as an access token" a parse failure rather than a

// ===== LIFETIMES, AND WHY THESE NUMBERS (design §7.2, task scope item 1) =====
//
// ACCESS = 1 HOUR. This is the direct answer to F3. The access token is the one
// presented constantly — every WS connect, every Hub API call — so it is the one
// most likely to be captured from a log, a proxy, a core dump or a disk image, and
// the only cheap control over a bearer credential is how long a captured copy
// remains useful. One hour is short enough that a stolen access token is an
// incident rather than a tenancy, and long enough that refresh traffic stays
// negligible: at 80% proactive refresh (§7.5) one bridge refreshes ~20 times a day,
// so even a thousand-bridge fleet is ~20k refreshes/day — nothing. Going shorter
// (5-10 min, as some OAuth deployments do) buys little here because the refresh
// token, not the access token, is the real long-lived secret, and it would multiply
// the one request that cannot be served from the bridge's cache.
//
// REFRESH = 30 DAYS SLIDING. The refresh token must outlive a bridge being powered
// off over a holiday; a machine that comes back after two weeks must reconnect
// without a human at a browser. Sliding (re-based on every rotation) means an
// actively-used bridge never re-enrolls, while an abandoned one ages out.
//
// FAMILY CAP = 365 DAYS ABSOLUTE. Sliding expiry alone means a credential used
// often never expires, which is how a machine decommissioned-but-still-running
// keeps access indefinitely. The cap is copied forward unchanged through every
// rotation, so it is a true ceiling and not another sliding window; reaching it
// requires re-enrollment, i.e. a human approving in a browser again.

// BRIDGE_TOKEN_CLOCK_SKEW_SECONDS is the grace added to every expiry comparison on
// the Hub side (task scope item 6: "a headless box with bad time must not brick
// itself").
//
// BE PRECISE ABOUT WHOSE CLOCK IS AT RISK, because the obvious reading is wrong.
// The Hub computes `expires_at` from its own clock and compares it against its own
// clock, so Hub-side skew cancels out entirely and this grace does nothing for it.
// The machine with the bad clock is the BRIDGE, and the structural fix is not a
// tolerance at all: the Hub returns `expires_in` as a DURATION, never an absolute
// timestamp, so a bridge schedules refresh off a monotonic timer and its wall clock
// never enters the decision. A bridge with a clock set to 1970 still refreshes
// correctly. That contract is REQ-IMPL-4's to implement and is posted as a task
// comment.
//
// What the 60s grace IS for: the boundary itself. A refresh that is in flight when
// the access token expires, or a request that crosses the second its expiry falls
// on, must not hard-fail; and the hub's timestamps have one-second resolution
// (format_rfc3339_utc), so a comparison at the edge is genuinely ambiguous. 60s is
// large enough to cover an in-flight request plus a retry and small enough that it
// does not meaningfully extend a stolen token's life (1h becomes 1h0m60s).

// BRIDGE_REFRESH_REUSE_GRACE_SECONDS implements design §7.4.4 and it is the one
// deliberate hole in reuse detection, so it is documented as a hole rather than as a

//
// THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES. Rotation is two writes on two machines: the Hub marks the
// old refresh token spent and returns a new one, then the bridge persists the new
// one. A power cut between those leaves a bridge holding a token the Hub considers
// spent — and under strict reuse detection its next refresh revokes the family, so a
// power cut at the wrong instant BRICKS the machine and needs a human at a browser.
// A two-phase commit is not available: the bridge cannot promise to persist.
//
// THE TRADE, stated honestly. For 30 seconds after a rotation, the
// immediately-previous refresh token is accepted ONE more time. An attacker who
// steals a refresh token and replays it inside that window therefore gets a working
// pair instead of being detected. What they do not get is silence: the orphaned
// generation is revoked, so the legitimate bridge's next refresh presents a revoked
// token and the family dies loudly. Detection is preserved for every generation but
// the newest, and for all but 30 seconds of that one.

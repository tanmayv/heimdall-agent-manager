// Tests for the expiring bridge credential: expiry enforcement, single-use
// rotation, reuse-as-theft family revocation, the crash-recovery grace window, the
// absolute family cap, kind confusion, and per-bridge isolation (REQ-IMPL-3).
//
// WHY A REAL SQLITE REPOSITORY AND NOT AN IN-MEMORY FAKE. Two of the properties
// under test are enforced IN SQL, not in this package: single-use rotation is the
// `AND rotated_at = ''` in bridge_mark_token_rotated_sqlite (so two concurrent
// refreshes of one token produce exactly one winner), and family revocation is one
// UPDATE across a lineage. A hand-written fake would satisfy the service's calls and
// quietly re-implement neither, which is how a test ends up asserting the mock.
//
// WHY A FAKE CLOCK. "An expired access token is rejected" is only provable
// deterministically if the test can stand on both sides of the boundary. The clock
// is a seam (platform.Clock) and every expiry on this path is derived from
// clock_now via platform.expires_at_after_seconds_from, so moving the fake forward
// an hour genuinely ages a credential — no sleeping, and no wall-clock flake.

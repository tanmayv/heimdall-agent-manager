// new_bridge_connection_closer builds the REQ-IMPL-3 / audit-F6 teardown seam: the
// thing revoke_bridge calls to terminate a revoked bridge's LIVE control
// WebSocket, rather than only flipping a DB row and leaving a connected bridge
// fully operational until it chooses to reconnect.
//
// IT LIVES HERE, in the one package that already joins the services to the runtime
// registry, so that the app wiring and the tests share EXACTLY this path. A test
// that built its own one-line closure would prove the registry works and prove
// nothing about what production actually wires up — which, for a revocation
// control, is the difference between a test and a reassurance.

// Both call sites do, and for a reason that got stricter when chunking landed. The lock

// interleave bytes inside one frame. It now also buys SEQUENCE-level serialisation:
// the bridge reassembles by chunk_id, so another command's CHUNKS must not appear
// between this sequence's chunks. Whole non-chunk frames landing between two chunks are
// fine and always were — the bridge passes those straight through while a reassembly is
// in flight — but a second interleaved SEQUENCE would have both streams open at once and
// is what the lock now prevents. This is the same pairing the bridge side documents on
// _bridge_hub_send_mu, reached from the other direction.

// ACK-LESS, deliberately, matching the other direction: this channel has no chunk_ack
// path, and a single ordered connection with the lock held means the bridge sees the

// REQ-SHELL-10 — the HUB HALF of the convergence protocol: apply one bridge's full
// session inventory and converge this hub's rows onto it.
//
// The chain's core invariant says no shell may be (a) running on a bridge but
// untracked by the hub, (b) marked live on the hub but not running on the bridge, or
// (c) un-killable. Everything else in the chain pursues those leak by leak — the exit
// outbox (REQ-SHELL-4) covers disconnect, the kill replay (REQ-SHELL-3) covers
// intent, the bridge's reconcile pass covers orphans. Each is sound, but a set of
// patches is only ever as complete as our list of failure modes. THIS is the part
// that needs no such list: the bridge states its whole truth, and every divergence,
// listed or not, falls out of one diff.
//
// THE FOUR BRANCHES, and what decides each:
//   hub row live, NOT in the inventory -> it died while we were away  -> TERMINAL
//   in the inventory, NO hub row       -> running untracked           -> ADOPT
//   status disagrees                   -> THE BRIDGE WINS             -> CORRECT
//   live row carrying a kill intent    -> deliver it now              -> REPLAY
//
// THE BRIDGE WINS, AND WHY THAT IS NOT MERELY A TIE-BREAK. The bridge owns the
// processes. Its inventory is built from the pty-host roster plus a ps check on each
// direct child (bridge_shell_session_reconcile), i.e. from OBSERVATION of the
// operating system; the hub's row is a memory of what it was last told. An
// observation beats a memory, which is the same rule
// domain.shell_session_terminal_is_observed already encodes for exits, applied to
// liveness instead of to death.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT OWN. It is triggered by an inventory, i.e. BY A RECONNECT. A
// bridge that never comes back never sends one, so this never fires for it and the
// rows would report live forever — that is REQ-SHELL-14's half, and neither task may
// assume the other covers its case. The two compose in one specific place, handled in
// _apply_entry below: REQ-SHELL-14 lands a SYNTHESIZED terminal status on a bridge
// judged gone, and if that bridge returns with the process still alive, this diff is
// the only thing that can correct it.
//
// SCOPE. A single inventory mutates MANY rows, so "a bridge may only touch its own
// sessions" carries more weight here than anywhere else in this service. It is
// enforced twice and structurally, not by inspection: the row set comes from
// list_live_by_bridge (bridge-scoped SQL) and every entry is resolved with
// get_by_id(bridge_id, session_id) (bridge-scoped SQL), so an inventory from bridge A
// naming bridge B's session resolves to nothing and changes nothing on B.

// SHELL_SESSION_INVENTORY_MAX_ROWS bounds the hub side of one diff, mirroring the
// bridge's BRIDGE_SHELL_INVENTORY_MAX_ENTRIES and, like it, a runaway backstop rather
// than pagination. Set ABOVE the bridge's cap on purpose: if a bound is going to bite
// it should be the one that can report that it bit (the bridge's `truncated` flag),
// not this one, which would silently shorten the row set and make live rows look
// absent.
SHELL_SESSION_INVENTORY_MAX_ROWS :: 1024

// SHELL_SESSION_INVENTORY_UNOBSERVED_TERMINAL is the status this diff lands on a
// session the bridge no longer lists.
//
// `failed` rather than `exited`, and the distinction is about what the hub is
// entitled to claim. `exited` reads as "ran to completion", which we did not see and
// have no exit code for; `failed` reads as "ended, and not verifiably well", which is
// exactly the truth: the bridge was away, the process ended at some point we did not
// observe. `killed` is excluded outright — nobody killed it.
//
// EXIT_CODE_SET IS DELIBERATELY LEFT FALSE here, and it is not an omission. It is the
// discriminator domain.shell_session_terminal_is_observed reads to tell a guess from
// an observation, and that predicate's own documentation makes this a CONDITION on
// the whole mechanism: the moment a hub-side path stamps a fabricated exit code, a
// guess starts outranking ground truth and the supersession in
// shell_session_handle_exited silently stops working. So this path records no code,
// and a late real exit from the bridge's durable outbox can still correct it.
//
// REQ-SHELL-14 lands a terminal status on the sessions of a bridge that never
// returns, which is the same KIND of claim made for a different reason. It should use
// this same spelling, for the same reasoning, rather than a second one.

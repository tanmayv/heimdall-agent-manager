// REQ-SHELL-8 item 6: retention for terminal shell_sessions ROWS.
//
// Output got a 5-day window; the rows it belongs to had none. Every run and every
// server a bridge ever executed left a row behind forever, so the owner-wide list,
// the per-bridge list and the chain summary all degraded permanently and could
// never recover. This is the missing half.

// HUB_SHELL_SESSION_ROW_RETENTION is how long a TERMINAL row survives after it
// ended. It is the middle link of the one ordered chain REQ-SHELL-8 maintains:
//
//     output 5 days  <  ROWS 7 days  <  tombstones 30 days
//
// GREATER THAN THE OUTPUT WINDOW, and that inequality is the requirement, not a
// preference: if rows expired first, a user would be shown a session whose output
// had already been reclaimed and get an error for every log they opened — the row
// would outlive the only thing it is good for. Keeping rows strictly longer instead
// means the opposite, benign case: for two days a row survives its output and says
// so explicitly, which is precisely what the .Gone answer exists to express.
//
// The other two windows live on the bridge, in src/bridge/shell_output_retention.odin
// (BRIDGE_SHELL_OUTPUT_RETENTION and BRIDGE_SHELL_TOMBSTONE_RETENTION), because that
// is where the files are. They are one chain across two processes: changing this
// number without checking those breaks a property that neither file can check alone.
HUB_SHELL_SESSION_ROW_RETENTION :: 7 * 24 * time.Hour

// shell_session_sweep_terminal_rows deletes terminal rows that ended more than
// HUB_SHELL_SESSION_ROW_RETENTION ago, and returns how many went.
//
// LIVE ROWS ARE NEVER TOUCHED, at any age. That is enforced by status in the SQL
// (built from domain.SHELL_SESSION_TERMINAL_STATUSES), not by a filter here, so no
// caller can pass an argument that makes a running server eligible. A server up for
// a month has a month-old row and keeps it.
//
// `now_rfc3339` is a parameter rather than a read of svc.clock so a test can place
// "now" days ahead and exercise the boundary without sleeping through it. Production
// passes platform.clock_now(svc.clock); an empty string falls back to that too, so a
// caller cannot accidentally sweep with no clock at all.
//
// REQ-SHELL-9 NOTE: this is the ONE terminal-row pass, called once from
// reaper_sweep_once. Server reaping should extend this proc or ride the same sweep
// call rather than adding a second walk of shell_sessions on the same cadence.

// shifts the whole window, and a wrong window is not visible in a delete count.

// Returns "" if `now` is not the fixed-width UTC form every timestamp column holds,
// rather than guessing at a cutoff: a malformed cutoff compared against real rows
// could delete far more than intended, so refusing is the only safe failure.

// shell_session_viewer_write_lock returns the write lock for a session's viewer sockets,

// session — and, for a multi-frame sequence, across the WHOLE sequence.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (REQ-SHELL-33). Two independent threads write a viewer's socket: the
// bridge-push path through shell_session_broadcast_output, and the stream handler's
// late-join screen snapshot (shell_stream_screen_snapshot.odin). Nothing serialised them.
// That was survivable only while the snapshot was a single frame — the original design
// note argues exactly that, and it was right: one absolute repaint either lands whole or
// not at all, and in-flight output is simply painted over.
//
// It stops being survivable the moment the snapshot spans several frames. The chunks after
// the first carry no erase+home and no absolute positioning: they continue from wherever
// the previous chunk left the cursor. An `output` frame delivered BETWEEN two chunks goes
// into the same terminal sink, moves the cursor, and every remaining chunk then paints from
// the wrong place — the staircase REQ-SHELL-30 and REQ-SHELL-31 removed, reintroduced
// intermittently. Ordering on the socket does not help: the guarantee the repaint needs is
// ATOMICITY against the other writer, not FIFO.
//
// Concurrent writes were in fact never safe here even at one frame each: two threads in
// net.send_tcp on the same socket can interleave at the BYTE level if the send buffer fills
// mid-copy, which corrupts the frame itself rather than merely the cursor. The lock closes
// both. (bridge_handlers.write_ws_text_frame_locked and the LSP registry lock are the same
// measure on their own sockets.)
//
// The lock is PER SESSION, not global: only writers to the same viewer socket can corrupt
// each other, and every writer to a socket writes it as a viewer of one session. A global
// lock would let a slow viewer of one session stall an unrelated one.
//
// LIFETIME — the entry is NOT freed when the session ends, and that is deliberate.
// Freeing it at the last detach would be a use-after-free: a writer takes the pointer,
// releases svc.mu, and only then blocks on the mutex, so a concurrent detach could free a
// lock another thread is about to take or is already holding. Making that safe needs
// refcounting, which buys nothing here — the entry is a pointer, an 8-byte mutex and a
// cloned key, it sits beside a `viewers` entry already retained for the same key on the
// same terms, and the growth is bounded by the number of DISTINCT session ids this process
// has seen. Both are freed together in shell_session_service_free.
// (The zero-growth alternative is a fixed array of striped locks hashed by session id. It
// was rejected because it reintroduces exactly what per-session locking is for: two
// unrelated sessions sharing a stripe, one able to stall the other.)
//
// This is NOT a bound on a WEDGED viewer. No send
// timeout is set on these sockets, so a viewer that stops draining already blocks the
// fan-out thread inside net.send_tcp; the lock extends that stall to the snapshot writer
// for the same session. Bounding it is the REQ-LSP-RLY-2 measure (SO_SNDTIMEO) and is not
// this ticket.

// ORDER IS THE WHOLE FIX: persist the intent, THEN dispatch. Dispatching first and

//
// A SECOND KILL WHILE ONE IS PENDING is a success, not a conflict. The repository

// The task allowed either; this is the choice with its reasoning.
//   - The intent lives in the hub DB, so the hub already knows the whole answer. A
//     pull would need a new bridge->hub request and a new hub endpoint to answer it,
//     to move data the hub could simply have sent.
//   - There is an exact precedent a few lines above the call site
//     (replay_bridge_actionable_notifications): "a cascade that fanned out to this
//     bridge while it was offline was dropped (fire-and-forget); on reconnect we
//     re-fire the current actionable state". This is the same problem and now has
//     the same shape.
//   - Decisively: the bridge's reconcile pass (bridge_shell_session_reconcile_now)
//     returns WITHOUT TOUCHING ANYTHING when the pty-host daemon is unreachable,
//     because without a daemon roster it cannot tell a live session from a dead one.
//     A kill riding that pass would then be silently deferred to the next reconnect
//     while appearing to work — which is the failure mode this task exists to remove,
//     reintroduced one layer down.
// It is NOT a poller either way: it runs once per reconnect, on an event, and adds no

//
// Idempotency is the bridge's, and deliberately so: a redelivered kill hits a session
// the bridge already marked terminal and is a no-op there. Replaying a kill the bridge
// already actioned is therefore harmless, which is what makes it safe to replay the

//
// IT REPORTS OUTSTANDING AS WELL AS DELIVERED (REQ-SHELL-23 AC3), and the second

// after a restart, against a different process under the same session — is not the
// same request being completed, it is a new and unasked-for one. There is also no
// durable state to converge on: "signal was requested" has no terminal condition to
// clear it, so it could only ever be an unbounded outbox.
// So a signal that cannot be delivered now is reported as failed, which is the
// honest answer, and the caller decides whether to ask again.

	// authorization as one. Ownership — the only check above — cannot catch this:
	// a user legitimately OWNS their own agent's run row (per-kind scope is
	// structural, not authz, and nothing may hide a user's own runs from them), so
	// the one check that passed is the one that could never have refused. Without
	// this gate a user-authenticated restart of an AGENT-ONLY `run` respawned it,
	// with the UI's verb gate as the only thing standing in the way — and the start
	// path's own comment says why that is not enough: the rule "must be enforced at
	// the API, not only in the UI".
	//
	// The rule itself is NOT restated here. It is read from
	// domain.SHELL_SESSION_STARTER_RULES through shell_session_kind_may_start, the
	// same table and predicate shell_session_start uses, via the same
	// _shell_session_starter_from_auth helper. One source of truth: a second
	// hardcoded `kind == .Run` list here is precisely how the two entry points
	// would drift apart.
	//
	// Note the parse: start gets its enum from the caller's INPUT, but a restart
	// has only the STORED row, whose kind is a string. An unparseable kind FAILS
	// CLOSED. A row whose kind the hub cannot name is not a row it can authorize a
	// respawn of, and the alternative — treating unknown as permitted — would
	// reintroduce this hole for exactly the rows that are already malformed.
	//
	// Placed above next_run_seq and above every bridge send on purpose: a refusal
	// that still delivered shell_restart would be a worse bug than the one this

	//
	//   restart FAILS (offline bridge, spawn error) -> the hub returns below without
	//     writing, and the bridge adopts the value only after a successful spawn. Both
	//     sides stay on the old run, so the old run's exits still apply. Advancing the

	//     would report an exit the hub then discarded as stale, leaving the row running
	//     forever.

	//   - the duplicate delivery of an exit that was already applied, which without
	//     this guard wrote the row a second time and published a second event to the
	//     owner, fanning one exit out twice;
	//   - a stale exit overtaken by a more accurate terminal status. A session the

	// come back and reports the genuine exit (which is exactly what a durable outbox
	// makes likely — that is this task), a flat first-terminal-wins would discard the
	// real exit and leave the guess standing forever, with a fabricated exit_code the
	// user has no way to correct. A guess must not outrank an observation.
	// See domain.shell_session_terminal_is_observed for how the two are told apart
	// and what REQ-SHELL-14 owes that predicate.

// destroy a twenty-minute build because a WebSocket blipped — and the hub could
// not deliver the kill to a bridge it had just lost anyway.
//
// Converting satisfies the actual requirement, which is that a foreground run must
// not survive as an untracked foreground run: a converted run stays tracked, stays
// addressable by its id, stays killable, stays reapable by reconcile, stays under
// the 30-minute process cap, and now notifies on completion instead of returning
// to a caller that is gone. Nothing is orphaned and nothing is destroyed.

// It is also ONE rule for every liveness signal (bridge-wide disconnect, the

// a user-visible failure was recoverable from nowhere: not the session row, not the

// here is lifted from the ONE site that already did it right — the set_server_port

// BUILDER-HEAP memory, and `domain_error` (domain/errors.odin:46) does NOT clone its
// message — it stores the string it is handed. So the reason is freed here and the
// returned message lives in the PER-REQUEST TEMP ARENA via fmt.tprintf, the same
// discipline as the port-conflict error above and the cmd_id note in shell_session_create.
//
// The guard on the delete is not defensive noise: `_json_str` returns a non-allocated ""

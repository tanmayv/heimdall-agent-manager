// REQ-SHELL-9 — SERVERS MUST NOT OUTLIVE THEIR PURPOSE.
//
// A `server` is the one kind with no natural end. A `run` is bounded by the 30-minute
// hard cap and a `shell` is an interactive terminal a person closes; a server is a
// long-running process started to serve something, and when the thing it served is over
// nothing in the system had an opinion about it. Two independent triggers close that,
// and they are independent on purpose — neither is a fallback for the other:
//
//   A. THE CHAIN CLOSED. Every server scoped to that chain dies. Purpose-driven, exact,
//      and immediate, hooked on the chain's terminal transition.
//   B. THE SERVER IS OLDER THAN A DAY. It dies regardless of chain state. This is the
//      backstop for a server whose chain never closes, or that was started outside any
//      chain's lifetime, and it rides the reaper that already runs.
//
// BOTH GO THROUGH THE REQ-SHELL-3 DURABLE KILL INTENT, never a bare send. A server on a
// disconnected bridge must still die when the bridge returns, which a fire-and-forget
// send cannot promise and an intent on the row can: shell_session_replay_kill_intents
// redelivers the outstanding set on reconnect. That is the whole reason this work
// depends on REQ-SHELL-3.
//
// ONLY SERVERS. A run and a shell are never touched by either trigger — see
// _reap_kill_if_eligible, which refuses any other kind even when a caller hands it one.

// SHELL_SESSION_REAP_MAX_ROWS bounds one reap, a runaway backstop rather than
// pagination, in the same spirit as SHELL_SESSION_INVENTORY_MAX_ROWS and
// SHELL_SESSION_KILL_REPLAY_MAX. Both reaps are idempotent and both run repeatedly, so
// anything a cap truncates is picked up by the next pass rather than lost — which is
// what makes a plain cap the right answer here instead of paging.
//
// It sits well above the per-chain live-server cap (REQ-SHELL-2 §11), so for the chain
// reap it can only ever bite on a database that has already broken that invariant.

// shell_session_reap_chain_servers kills every LIVE SERVER of one chain. It is trigger
// A, called from the task chain's terminal transition, and it returns how many kills it
// recorded.
//
// THE KIND FILTER IS THE QUERY'S, NOT MINE, AND THAT IS THE POINT. list_by_chain narrows
// on chain_id AND on the kinds whose scope key includes .Chain (repo_sqlite's
// shell_session_kind_scope_clause, built from domain.SHELL_SESSION_SCOPE_RULES). Server
// is the only kind keyed by .Chain, so this listing CANNOT return a run or a shell —
// not because this proc filters them out, but because REQ-SHELL-1's descriptor makes a
// by-chain listing meaningless for the other two. A client-side kind check here would be
// a second spelling of a rule that already has one.
// _reap_kill_if_eligible re-asserts it anyway, as defence against a future scope-table
// edit rather than as the primary guarantee.
//
// status = "live" comes from the same place: the repository translates it from
// domain.SHELL_SESSION_TERMINAL_STATUSES, so "already terminal" is excluded by the
// query, by the one definition of terminal, rather than by an eye-check here.
//
// OWNER-SCOPED, unlike the age reap: a chain row carries owner_user_id, so this path has
// a real owner and does not need an unscoped read. Passing the chain's owner also means
// a chain can only ever reap its OWN servers.
//
// REOPENING A CHAIN DOES NOT RESURRECT ANYTHING. valid_chain_transition allows
// Completed -> Active, and a chain reopened after this ran comes back with its servers
// dead. That is deliberate: the processes are gone, and a hub cannot restart a process
// it did not keep. Whoever reopens the chain starts what they still need.

// shell_session_reap_aged_servers kills every LIVE SERVER whose age exceeds max_age_ms.
// It is trigger B, called from the reaper sweep, and it returns how many kills it
// recorded.
//
// `now_ms` and `max_age_ms` are PARAMETERS, not read from a clock here, which is what
// lets a test place a server 25 hours in the past instead of waiting 25 hours (AC2
// requires injected timestamps, not sleeping). The window's value and the argument for
// it live at REAPER_SERVER_MAX_AGE_MS in src/hub/app/reaper.odin, next to the other
// reaper thresholds.
//
// AGE IS MEASURED FROM started_at, NOT created_at. created_at is when the HUB WROTE THE
// ROW; started_at is when the PROCESS BEGAN. They differ by however long the start took
// to be confirmed, and a slow start is not age. The requirement is "servers older than
// one day", which is a statement about a running process, so the process's own clock is
// the one that answers it.
//
// A ROW WHOSE started_at IS EMPTY OR UNPARSEABLE IS SKIPPED, never reaped. An empty
// started_at means the hub has not yet been told the process began, and treating an
// unreadable timestamp as infinitely old would kill the youngest sessions in the table —
// the destructive direction. This mirrors reaper_bridge_absence_is_terminal and
// reap_stale_instances, both of which skip rather than guess. The cost is bounded and
// covered elsewhere: a session stuck without a started_at on a bridge that dies is
// closed by REQ-SHELL-14's gone-bridge sweep, and one on a live bridge is corrected by
// REQ-SHELL-10's inventory diff.
//
// A FUTURE-DATED started_at is likewise not old, which falls out of the signed
// comparison: clock skew between hub and bridge must not manufacture age.

// _reap_kill_if_eligible is the ONE gate both triggers pass through, and the one place
// the reap's skip rules are written. It returns whether a kill was recorded.
//
// THREE REFUSALS, in the order that makes each one's reason clearest:
//
//  1. NOT A SERVER -> refuse. A `run` is already bounded by the 30-minute hard cap and a
//     `shell` is an interactive terminal a person is sitting at; reaping either would be
//     destroying someone's live work on a timer. AC4 demands this be asserted rather
//     than inferred, so it is checked here even though the chain reap's query already
//     makes it structurally impossible — this is the assertion that survives a future
//     edit to the scope table, and the only kind check the age path has.
//
//  2. ALREADY TERMINAL -> refuse. The process is gone; an intent on a finished row is
//     spent by definition. Read through the domain predicate, not by comparing status
//     strings, so terminal means one thing everywhere.
//
//  3. ALREADY CARRYING A PENDING INTENT -> refuse, AND THIS IS WHERE THE REAP
//     DELIBERATELY DIFFERS FROM shell_session_kill. The user-facing accept path
//     RE-DISPATCHES a kill that is already pending, because a human clicking kill twice
//     means "try again" and redelivery is a no-op on the bridge. A sweep is not a human:
//     it runs every 20 seconds, so for a server on a bridge that has been offline for an
//     hour, re-dispatching would mean 180 identical sends that all fail, replacing the
//     one durable intent the design relies on with noise. The intent is already
//     recorded; the reconnect replay owns delivery from here. AC5 is this line.
//
// Both refusals 2 and 3 are why the reaps are safe to run repeatedly — which in turn is
// what makes it safe to call the chain reap from all three of the chain's close paths
// rather than hunting for a single choke point that does not exist.

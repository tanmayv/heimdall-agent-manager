// REQ-SHELL-41 (P0 addendum): SHELL VIEWER OBSERVABILITY.
//
// WHY. The coordinator's P0 note pinned the cost precisely: a viewer being silently
// unsubscribed is a KNOWN failure mode of this subsystem — it is what REQ-SHELL-33
// fixed — and shell_session_detach logged nothing, so if it happened again there would
// be no trace at all. In shell_session_broadcast_output the two branches were
// asymmetric: a non-ending write result was logged by _log_viewer_write, while the
// branch that actually DETACHED A LIVE VIEWER fell through to shell_session_detach and
// said nothing. The louder event was the silent one.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT LOGGED: the Ok result on a viewer write. That path carries
// PTY output at roughly 11KB every 25ms, so logging it would be a defect in its own
// right (REQ-SHELL-41 AC3). Only non-Ok results, detaches, and the single first frame
// after a 0->1 viewer transition are recorded — all of them bounded per session, none
// of them per frame.

// Shell_Viewer_Detach_Reason names WHY a viewer was removed from a session's fan-out.
// The distinction that matters is ORDINARY (the viewer's own stream handler returned)
// versus FORCED (the hub dropped a live viewer because a write failed) — conflating
// those is what made REQ-SHELL-33's silent unsubscribe so expensive to find.
Shell_Viewer_Detach_Reason :: enum {
	// No reason supplied. Reachable only from callers that have not been updated, and
	// rendered as "unspecified" so it reads as a gap rather than as something benign.
	Unspecified,
	// The viewer's own WS stream handler returned and detached on its way out. The
	// ordinary case, and the only one that is not a symptom.
	Stream_Closed,
	// A write found the client gone. The viewer did not ask to leave.
	Peer_Gone,
	// A write left a partial frame on the wire, so the stream is unparseable from here
	// on and ending it IS the recovery. Still a forced detach, and still worth a line.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// First-frame tracking for the 0->1 viewer transition.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The P0 note asks for the FIRST frame emitted after a session gains its first viewer,
// with session id and byte count — the line that answers "did anything ever actually
// reach the browser" for a session that renders nothing. That needs one bit of state
// per session, remembered between the attach and the next output frame.
//
// A FIXED SLOT TABLE, NOT A MAP, AND THE REASON IS SPECIFIC. The service's existing
// per-session maps (session_owners, session_bridges) own heap-cloned keys, and their
// removal path carries a documented use-after-free hazard around freeing a key while
// still indexing by it (shell_session_service.odin:1419). Adding a fourth map of the
// same shape would mean joining that discipline for one bit of diagnostic state. This
// table stores ids inline instead, so it allocates nothing, frees nothing, and cannot
// participate in that hazard. An entry left behind by a session that never emitted a
// frame is reclaimed by eviction, not by bookkeeping.

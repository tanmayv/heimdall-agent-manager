// REAPER_STALE_MS mirrors the request-driven sweep threshold used on bridge
// heartbeats (http.BRIDGE_INSTANCE_STALE_MS = 90s): an instance still in an
// active runtime state whose last_seen_at is older than this is flipped to
// "unreachable". Kept generously above the ~2s heartbeat cadence so a briefly
// slow bridge is never falsely reaped.
REAPER_STALE_MS :: 90_000

// DEFAULT_REAPER_INTERVAL_SECONDS is used when the configured interval is <= 0.
DEFAULT_REAPER_INTERVAL_SECONDS :: 20

// REAPER_BRIDGE_GONE_MS is how long a bridge must go UNHEARD-FROM before the hub
// declares it gone for good and lands a terminal status on its live shell sessions
// (REQ-SHELL-14, core invariant (b) for the never-came-back case).
//
// IT IS DELIBERATELY FAR ABOVE THE LIVENESS THRESHOLDS, and not a reuse of them.
// REAPER_STALE_MS (90s) and http.BRIDGE_INSTANCE_STALE_MS answer "is it responding
// right now". This answers "is it never coming back", a categorically stronger claim
// about a remote machine, so it must not borrow their number: at 45s heartbeats, 90s
// is two missed beats, which is a blip.
//
// THE TRIGGER IS ABSENCE OVER TIME, NEVER "DISCONNECTED". Three call sites in this
// codebase deliberately CONVERT rather than kill on a WS drop, because a drop is
// usually transient with the child processes alive; reacting to disconnect here would
// reintroduce exactly the destroyed-in-flight-work failure those sites exist to
// prevent — a 20-minute build killed by a network hiccup.
//
// WHY ONE HOUR, in both directions, because the next reader will be tempted to tighten
// it and that is the dangerous way to be wrong:
//   TOO SHORT destroys real work. A long outage on a live bridge would mark running
//     sessions failed while their processes are fine.
//   TOO LONG only leaves a row stale for longer.
// Those costs are NOT symmetric, and the asymmetry is what picks the number: because
// REQ-SHELL-10's inventory diff REVIVES a session the hub wrongly called terminal once
// the bridge returns with the process alive, being early is bounded and self-healing,
// while being late costs only staleness. An hour is comfortably longer than any
// plausible partition or bridge restart, and short enough that a genuinely dead
// bridge's rows do not advertise themselves as live for a working day.
// That revive is a CONDITION on this constant, not a bonus: if it ever stops firing for
// hub-synthesized rows, this threshold becomes destructive rather than conservative.
// It is asserted by test for exactly that reason.
REAPER_BRIDGE_GONE_MS :: 60 * 60 * 1000

// REAPER_SERVER_MAX_AGE_MS is how old a `server` may get before it is killed regardless
// of chain state (REQ-SHELL-9 trigger B). The user's words: "kill all servers once task
// chain completes OR are older than 1 day".
//
// AGE IS MEASURED FROM started_at, NOT created_at. created_at is when the hub wrote the
// row; started_at is when the process began. The requirement is about a process that has
// been running too long, so the process's own clock answers it — see
// shell_session_reap_aged_servers, which also documents why an unparseable or empty
// started_at is skipped rather than treated as infinitely old.
//
// WHY 24 HOURS IS NOT A THRESHOLD TO TUNE. Unlike REAPER_BRIDGE_GONE_MS above, this
// number was not chosen by weighing failure costs — it was GIVEN. Anyone tempted to
// lower it should understand that it is not a heuristic about when a server is probably
// abandoned; it is the product decision about how long a server is allowed to live.
// Changing it changes the promise, not the accuracy of a guess.
//
// IT IS ONLY A BACKSTOP. The chain-completion trigger is the one that normally ends a
// server's life, and it is immediate. This catches the cases that trigger cannot see: a
// chain that never closes, and a server started outside any chain's lifetime.
REAPER_SERVER_MAX_AGE_MS :: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000

// REAPER_LIVE_BRIDGE_IDS_MAX bounds the candidate listing, a runaway backstop rather
// than pagination — mirroring SHELL_SESSION_INVENTORY_MAX_ROWS. The query already
// narrows to bridges HOLDING LIVE SESSIONS, which is small; this only stops a
// pathological table from allocating without limit on a 20-second loop.
REAPER_LIVE_BRIDGE_IDS_MAX :: 1024

// reaper_loop is the periodic background safety net for stale agent instances.
//
// Why it exists: the hub's staleness reap was REQUEST-DRIVEN only — it ran on
// inbound bridge heartbeats. If a whole bridge dies and never reconnects, no
// heartbeat arrives, so its instances stay runtime_status='running' forever
// (the clean-disconnect cascade in bridge_ws_disconnect covers an observed WS
// close, but not a hub restart with a persisted DB, a silently half-open
// connection, or a lost close). This loop re-evaluates staleness on a fixed
// cadence independent of bridge traffic and flips stranded instances to
// 'unreachable', publishing resource_changed so the UI self-heals live.
//
// Thread-safety: this runs in its own process-scoped thread (launched from
// app.run before the blocking http.serve). It uses the EXACT same access
// pattern the HTTP request threads already use concurrently — the server spawns
// one thread per client, all sharing graph.agents + graph.event_bus with no
// mutex, and request handlers already call agent_service.reap_stale_instances +
// events.publish_resource_changed. So this adds no new shared-state contract.

//
// SHAPE, and why it is this way round. It asks the SESSION table which bridges hold live
// rows, then asks each of those bridges how long it has been absent — not the reverse.
// The candidate set is therefore bounded by what can actually need reaping rather than
// by every bridge ever enrolled, and a bridge with nothing running costs one query row
// and no bridge read at all. On a 20-second loop that difference is the whole design.
//
// THE AGE TEST LIVES HERE, IN ODIN, NOT IN SQL. That mirrors reap_stale_instances, which
// likewise takes a candidate set from the repository and judges age itself, and it keeps
// the threshold next to the comment that justifies it instead of splitting the rule
// between a constant and a WHERE clause.
//
// MEMORY: this runs on the process-scoped reaper thread, which has NO per-request arena,
// so every HEAP allocation here is freed explicitly — the bridge id list and each id in
// it, and each cloned last_seen_at. Nothing is left for a later pass to tidy, because
// there is no later pass; a leak here would accumulate every 20 seconds forever.
// The word HEAP is load-bearing: the one value on this path that is NOT a heap block is
// the clock_now timestamp, and freeing it is a crash rather than a tidy-up. See below.

	// non-heap pointer through the heap allocator — an invalid free, not a tidy-up.

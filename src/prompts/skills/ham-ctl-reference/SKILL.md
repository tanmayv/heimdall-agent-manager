name: ham-ctl-reference
description: Authoritative command reference for the ham-ctl agent CLI — every group (bridge, agents, task-chain, task, issue, chat, memory, artifact, shell, shell-cmd, context, start-success) with exact verbs, flags, and valid values. Also covers shell sessions as a way to put a running process in front of the user — they can watch its stdout live and, if it serves HTTP on a declared port, open its UI as a preview in Heimdall — no inbound port on either machine, and it works when the Hub is on a different host. Includes how two services in separate sessions call each other through the Hub. Load whenever you need the precise ham-ctl syntax for a Heimdall action and want to get flags, positional ids, task/chain statuses, vote results, or memory scopes right the first time.

# ham-ctl command reference

`ham-ctl` is the agent control CLI for Heimdall. Every command is callable with your
agent token (already configured) via the managed wrapper in your run directory:

```
./.heimdall/bin/ham-ctl <group> <verb> [<positional-id>] [--flags]
```

Conventions used below:
- `<id>` positional args come right after the verb; most commands need only the
  positional id (task/chain ids are globally unique, so `--chain` is usually optional).
- Each command prints a single JSON response line.
- Run `./.heimdall/bin/ham-ctl <group> --help` for the built-in reference of any group;
  `./.heimdall/bin/ham-ctl --help` lists all groups.

Groups: `bridge`, `agents`, `task-chain`, `task`, `issue`, `chat`, `memory`, `artifact`,
`shell`, `shell-cmd`, `context`, `start-success`.

---

## bridge — discover bridges and their providers
- `bridge list [--scope hub|configured|all]` — bridges you can target. Default `all` =
  Hub-registered + locally-configured peers + this host (self).
- `bridge providers [--bridge <id>]` — providers (and tiers) for one bridge, or all.

## agents — durable identities, templates, and runtime instances
- `agents list` — your durable agent identities.
- `agents identity create --name <n> [--template <id>] [--provider <p>] [--tier <t>] [--slug <s>] [--instructions <t>]` — create a durable agent.
- `agents template list` — list agent templates (personas).
- `agents template create --name <n> [--description <d>] [--persona <t>] [--instructions <t>]` — create a template.
- `agents instance list [--agent <id>] [--live]` — list instances (durable, or only live with `--live`).
- `agents new-instance <agent-id> [--project <id>] [--bridge <id>] [--provider <p>] [--tier <t>] [--chain <id>]` — launch a NEW instance of a durable agent.
- `agents start <instance-id>` — start a STOPPED instance (errors if already running).
- `agents stop <instance-id> [--reason <t>]` — stop a running instance.
- `agents restart <instance-id>` — restart (stop-then-start) an instance.

## task-chain — your task chains
- `task-chain list [--mine] [--project <id>]` — chains (`--mine` = ones you coordinate).
- `task-chain show [<chain-id>]` — show a chain (defaults to your current chain), including embedded `tasks` and `directories`.
- `task-chain set-title <title> [--chain <id>]` — rename a chain (coordinator only).
- `task-chain set-description <text> [--chain <id>]` (or `--stdin`) — set the chain
  description (coordinator only; pass `""` to clear; `--chain` defaults to your chain).
- `task-chain set-status --status <active|completed|cancelled> [--chain <id>]` — change
  the chain status (coordinator only). Chain statuses are exactly `active`, `completed`,
  `cancelled`. This is how a coordinator completes a chain.
- `task-chain reconcile <chain-id>` — self-heal / kick off a chain: promote actionable
  tasks, set each agent's current task, and nudge idle agents. **The chain id is REQUIRED**
  (positional, or `--chain <id>`; with neither it just prints help). Coordinator/owner only,
  idempotent. See the `coordinator-task-management` skill for when to run it.

### Relevant directories (`task-chain directory`)
Associate one or more working directories (local checkouts, CitC workspaces, repos) with a task chain so participating agents and the UI know which workspaces/directories are in scope. Directories are also embedded directly in `task-chain show [<chain-id>]` and `GET /api/v1/task-chains/:id` output under the `"directories"` array.

- `task-chain directory list [--chain <id>]` — list relevant directories for a task chain (`--chain` defaults to your current chain).
- `task-chain directory add --path <path> [--bridge <bridge_id>] [--vcs-kind <kind>] [--chain <id>]` — associate a directory with the chain.
- `task-chain directory update <directory-id> [--path <path>] [--bridge <bridge_id>] [--vcs-kind <kind>] [--chain <id>]` — update an existing directory entry.
- `task-chain directory remove <directory-id> [--chain <id>]` — disassociate a directory from the chain.

#### Directory JSON shape (lean payload)
Directory objects use a lean payload shape containing only operational fields. To keep coordination lightweight, metadata like timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`) and authorship/owner fields are intentionally omitted:

```json
{
  "directory_id": "dir_18d7a123bc45de67",
  "path": "/usr/local/google/home/tanmayvijay/heimdall-cloudtop",
  "bridge_id": "brg_18d03379a7d6d47b",
  "vcs_kind": "git",
  "vcs": {}
}
```

Fields:
- `directory_id`: Unique identifier for the directory record (`dir_...`).
- `path`: Target directory path on the bridge host.
- `bridge_id`: Identifier of the bridge where the directory resides.
- `vcs_kind`: Version control system kind (`git`, `citc`, `jj`, or empty).
- `vcs`: Object containing VCS-specific details (branch, commit, status, etc.).

#### Command examples
```bash
# List directories for the current chain
ham-ctl task-chain directory list

# List directories for a specific chain
ham-ctl task-chain directory list --chain chain_18d711c5384a0119

# Add a directory to the chain
ham-ctl task-chain directory add --path /usr/local/google/home/tanmayvijay/heimdall-cloudtop --bridge brg_18d03379a7d6d47b --vcs-kind git

# Add a directory to a specific chain
ham-ctl task-chain directory add --chain chain_18d711c5384a0119 --path /google/src/cloud/tanmayvijay/heimdall --vcs-kind citc

# Update an existing directory's path or bridge
ham-ctl task-chain directory update dir_18d7a123bc45de67 --path /usr/local/google/home/tanmayvijay/heimdall-cloudtop-v2

# Remove a directory from the chain
ham-ctl task-chain directory remove dir_18d7a123bc45de67

# View chain details with embedded directories
ham-ctl task-chain show chain_18d711c5384a0119
```

### Fleet management (`task-chain fleet`)
Configure and inspect agent concurrency caps (fleets) for a task chain. Fleets allow tasks to be assigned to durable agent types (`agt_...`) instead of individual instances (`inst_...`). Heimdall dynamically routes or provisions worker instances to satisfy fleet capacity quotas.

- `task-chain fleet list [<chain-id>]` — list fleet capacities and live active worker counts for a chain (defaults to current chain if omitted).
- `task-chain fleet set <chain-id> --agent <agent_id> --capacity <N> [--min-warm <M>] [--idle-ttl <seconds>]` — configure fleet capacity for an agent class on the chain.

#### Fleet JSON shape
`task-chain fleet list` returns a JSON array of fleet configurations:
```json
[
  {
    "chain_id": "chain_18d711c5384a0119",
    "agent_id": "agt_worker",
    "capacity": 3,
    "active_count": 1,
    "min_warm": 0,
    "idle_ttl_seconds": 300,
    "created_at": "2026-09-24T00:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-09-24T00:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

Fields:
- `chain_id`: Unique identifier of the task chain (`chain_...`).
- `agent_id`: Durable agent template identifier (`agt_...`).
- `capacity`: Maximum concurrent running worker instances allocated for this agent on the chain.
- `active_count`: Currently active (running or busy) worker instances assigned to tasks in this chain.
- `min_warm`: Minimum warm standby instances to maintain.
- `idle_ttl_seconds`: Time before idle instances are stopped or decommissioned.

#### Command examples
```bash
# List fleets for the current chain
ham-ctl task-chain fleet list

# List fleets for a specific chain
ham-ctl task-chain fleet list chain_18d711c5384a0119

# Set worker fleet capacity to 4
ham-ctl task-chain fleet set chain_18d711c5384a0119 --agent agt_worker --capacity 4

# Set reviewer fleet capacity with warm standby and idle timeout
ham-ctl task-chain fleet set chain_18d711c5384a0119 --agent agt_reviewer --capacity 2 --min-warm 1 --idle-ttl 600
```

## task — tasks within a chain
A positional `<task-id>` identifies the task and is enough on its own (task ids are
globally unique — you rarely need `--chain`).

- `task list [--chain <id>]` — your chain's tasks. Each carries a `comment_summary`
  (count, last_comment_at, author, preview) — NOT full comment bodies.
- `task show <task-id> [--chain <id>]` — a task + its `comment_summary` + votes (no bodies).
- `task comments <task-id> [--last N]` — fetch comment BODIES; `--last N` = newest N (max 100).
- `task create --title <t> [--description <d>] [--priority p0|p1|p2] [--assignee <instance-or-agent-id>] [--reviewer <id,id,...>] [--depends-on <id,id>] [--chain <id>]` — create a task.
  `--assignee` and `--reviewer` accept both live instance IDs (`inst_...`) and durable agent IDs (`agt_...`). When an `agt_...` ID is provided, it is automatically serialized as an actor reference `{"type":"agent_id","agent_id":"<id>"}` for fleet dispatch.
  `--reviewer` and `--depends-on` accept comma-separated lists.
- `task update <task-id> [--title <t>] [--description <d>] [--priority p0|p1|p2] [--assignee <instance-or-agent-id>] [--reviewer <id,id,...>] [--depends-on <id,id>]` — edit an
  existing task (coordinator only). Only the fields you pass change; `--assignee` and `--reviewer` support both `inst_...` and `agt_...` IDs; `--reviewer` and
  `--depends-on` REPLACE the whole list (pass `""` to clear).
- `task comment <task-id> --body <t>` (or `--stdin`) `[--notify <id,id>]` — add a comment
  (the only way to comment).
- `task status <task-id> --status <s>` — change status. Use `in_validation` to submit for
  review. **There is no `done` verb.**
- `task vote <task-id> --result <lgtm|ngtm> [--comment <t>]` — cast a review vote (the only
  way to vote). `--result` must be exactly `lgtm` or `ngtm`.
- `task nudge <task-id> [--message <t>]` — nudge the task's owner.
- `task set-current <task-id>` — mark this as your current task.
- `task depend <task-id> --on <task-id>` — add a single dependency (`update --depends-on`
  replaces the whole list).

### Task statuses (the only valid `--status` values)
`assigned`, `queued`, `in_progress`, `in_validation`, `validated_good`,
`validated_not_good`, `paused`, `completed`, `cancelled`.

**There is no `approved` status and no explicit approve/complete-task verb.** Approval is
IMPLICIT: when a task is `in_validation` and its required reviewers reach an LGTM quorum
with no `ngtm`, the Hub auto-finalizes the task straight to `completed` (that is also the
only outcome that unblocks dependents — `validated_good` does not). A single `ngtm` moves
it to `validated_not_good` for rework. So the assignee's job is `--status in_validation`;
the reviewer's job is `--result lgtm|ngtm`; completion happens on its own.

## issue — track, discuss, and vote on issues and blockers
Manage defects, toolchain quirks, environment problems, and out-of-scope bugs across
the system. Supports lean list views, detail inspect with threaded comments, voting
with single-vote enforcement per instance/user, and unvoting.

A positional `<issue-id>` identifies the issue right after the verb.

- `issue list [--status <new|fixed|obsolete>] [--scope <global|project|agent_id|bridge_id>] [--target-id <id>] [--chain <id>] [--query <text>] [--voter-id <id>] [--limit <limit>] [--offset <offset>]` — list issues. Returns a **lean payload** containing `description_preview`, `comment_count`, `vote_count`, and `has_voted` (when voter ID is supplied), omitting the full description and comments array.
- `issue show <issue-id> [--voter-id <id>]` — show full issue details, including the full `description`, metadata, `closed_at`, `vote_count`, `comment_count`, `has_voted` (for the specified or caller identity), and embedded `comments` array.
- `issue create --title <title> [--description <desc>] [--scope <global|project|agent_id|bridge_id>] [--target-id <id>] [--chain <id>] [--created-by <id>]` — create a new issue with status `new`.
- `issue update <issue-id> [--title <title>] [--description <desc>] [--status <new|fixed|obsolete>] [--scope <scope>] [--target-id <id>] [--chain <id>]` — update an issue. Setting status to `fixed` or `obsolete` automatically populates the `closed_at` timestamp; setting back to `new` clears `closed_at`.
- `issue comment <issue-id> --body <body> [--stdin] [--author-id <id>] [--author-name <name>]` — add a comment to an issue.
- `issue comment <issue-id> list` (or `issue comments <issue-id>`) — list comments for an issue.
- `issue vote <issue-id> [--voter-id <id>] [--voter-name <name>]` — cast an upvote on an issue. Each user or agent instance can vote only once; duplicate votes are rejected with HTTP 409 Conflict. Increments `vote_count` and sets `has_voted: true`.
- `issue unvote <issue-id> [--voter-id <id>]` — retract a previously cast vote. Decrements `vote_count` and sets `has_voted: false`. Returns 404 if no vote exists for the voter.
- `issue delete <issue-id>` (or `issue remove <issue-id>`) — permanently delete an issue, including its comments and votes.

### Issue statuses and scopes
- **Statuses**:
  - `new` — open issue (default upon creation).
  - `fixed` — resolved issue (sets `closed_at`).
  - `obsolete` — discarded / no longer relevant (sets `closed_at`).
- **Scopes** (`--scope` / `--scope-type`):
  - `global` — system-wide or cross-project defects (default).
  - `project` — project-specific defects (`--target-id` specifies project ID).
  - `agent_id` (alias `agent`) — agent template or runtime instance issues (`--target-id` specifies agent ID).
  - `bridge_id` (alias `bridge`) — host/bridge-specific issues (`--target-id` specifies bridge ID).

```

## chat — inbox, sending, and this conversation's title
- `chat read [--limit N] [--since T] [--include-read] [--transcript]` — read messages.
- `chat send --to <user|agent-instance-id> --body <t>` (or `--stdin`) — send a message.
  `--to` is REQUIRED: `user` for the bound user, or an exact agent-instance-id for
  agent-to-agent.
- `chat set-title <title>` — rename THIS conversation (the chat thread shown in the UI).
  Distinct from `task-chain set-title`, which renames the chain board.

## shell — long-lived PTY/shell sessions on the Bridge host
Distinct from `shell-cmd`: `shell-cmd` runs one command and returns its output; `shell`
creates a NAMED, durable session (a process that keeps running) you can later signal,
log, or reach over HTTP. Authenticates with your agent token, same as `shell-cmd`.
- `shell start --bridge <id> [--kind interactive|server|command] [--cmd <cmd>]
  [--cwd <dir>] [--label <lbl>] [--port <n>] [--project <id>] [--chain <id>]` — launch a
  session. Returns `{session_id, status, pid}`.
  - `--port <n>` declares the port the process binds. A declared port is what makes the
    session reachable over HTTP (see below), whatever its `--kind`. It does not have to
    be declared at start — see `shell set-port`.
- `shell list --bridge <id> | --chain <id> [--project <id>] [--status <s>]` — one of
  `--bridge` or `--chain` is REQUIRED. `--project` alone fails with
  `chain_id query parameter is required`. Columns: session_id, kind, label, status, pid,
  server_port, uptime.
- `shell log <session_id> [--offset N] [--limit N] [--grep <pattern>]` — returns
  `{lines, truncated, total_lines}`. Same paging shape as `shell-cmd read`.
- `shell capture <session_id>` — snapshot of the current terminal screen.
- `shell signal <session_id> --signal <int>` — send a POSIX signal (e.g. 2 = SIGINT).
- `shell restart <session_id>` — stop then start; returns `{session_id, pid, status}`.
- `shell set-port <session_id> --port <n> | --clear` — declare (or clear) the port of a
  session that is ALREADY running, for the usual case: you open an interactive terminal,
  then decide to run a server in it, so there was nothing to declare at start. Takes
  effect immediately on both access paths, with no restart. `--port 0` and `--clear` are
  the same request. Refused with 409 on a session that has exited, and 404 on one you do
  not own. Returns the updated session.
- `shell kill <session_id>` — terminate the session.

### Sending an HTTP request to a server session, via the Bridge
A `--kind server --port N` session is reachable from this host through the Bridge's
local endpoint — the same endpoint `ham-ctl` itself talks to. No inbound port is opened
and no user token or browser session is involved:

```
http://127.0.0.1:<local_endpoint_port>/proxy/<session_id>/<path>
```

The Bridge relays over the WebSocket it already holds to the Hub; the Hub splices it to
the Bridge that owns `<session_id>`, and that Bridge dials `127.0.0.1:<declared port>`.
Method, path, query string and body are all forwarded.

Find the local endpoint port (TCP fallback; default `49324`) with
`bridge list --scope configured` -> `{"local_endpoint_port": 49324}`. The unix socket
path is in `$HEIMDALL_BRIDGE_ENDPOINT` (`unix:/path/to/bridge.sock`).

```bash
# start a server session
ham-ctl shell start --bridge brg_abc --kind server --port 8000 \
  --cwd /srv/site --cmd 'python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1'
# -> {"session_id":"sh_123","status":"running","pid":...}

# reach it over TCP
curl http://127.0.0.1:49324/proxy/sh_123/index.html

# or: an interactive session you started a server inside afterwards
ham-ctl shell set-port sh_456 --port 3000
curl http://127.0.0.1:49324/proxy/sh_456/

# or over the unix socket ham-ctl already uses
curl --unix-socket "${HEIMDALL_BRIDGE_ENDPOINT#unix:}" \
  http://localhost/proxy/sh_123/index.html
```

The target must be `status=running`, have a declared port, and be owned by you. Any
session kind qualifies — an interactive shell you started a server inside is reachable
too, whether the port was declared with `start --port` or later with `set-port`.
Refusals come back as JSON `{"error":"<reason>"}`:

| status | reason | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 404 | `session_not_found` | no such session, or it is not yours |
| 409 | `session_not_running` | session has exited |
| 409 | `no_server_port` | no port declared — use `shell set-port` |
| 403 | `cross_owner` | belongs to another user |
| 503 | `unavailable` | Bridge cannot reach the Hub |

Any process on this host that can reach the local endpoint can use this path and acts
with the Bridge owner's authority; it is disabled by `--no-local-proxy` or
`[bridge] local_proxy_enabled=false`.

### Showing a running process to the user
A session serves two user-facing surfaces at once, and both are live:

- **stdout** — any session, no port needed. The user sees it in the session pane; you
  read the same stream with `shell log <session_id>`.
- **a preview** — any session with a declared port. The Hub serves it to the user's
  browser at `<hub-origin>/api/v1/preview/<session_id>/`, tunnelled to the Bridge that
  owns the session. Nothing is exposed: no inbound port is opened on the Bridge host or
  the Hub, and it works with the Hub on a different machine.

So `shell start --port N` is the way to hand someone a dev server, a report, a
dashboard, or any HTTP UI running on a Bridge host they cannot reach directly.

### Two sessions calling each other through the Hub
Every preview lives under the same parent path, so a page in one session reaches a
service in another with a **relative** URL — no host, no port, no Hub name in the page:

```js
// page served at <hub>/api/v1/preview/<FE_SESSION>/
const api = (p) => new URL(`../${BACKEND_SESSION}/${p}`, location.href).toString();
//   -> <hub>/api/v1/preview/<BACKEND_SESSION>/<p>
```

Both sessions are then same-origin with the Hub and with each other, so this needs no
CORS headers and triggers no preflight. The same relative form also resolves correctly
under the Bridge-local `/proxy/<session_id>/` path above, because that path has the same
`<prefix>/<session_id>/` shape — which means you can verify a browser flow server-side
with `curl` before anyone opens it.

Verified end to end: `POST` crosses the tunnel with method and body intact, responses
carry real server state across calls, and non-2xx statuses propagate unchanged (a 404
from the target arrives as a 404, not as a tunnel error).

**Limitation — no service discovery.** A session id does not exist until
`shell start` returns, and it is *not* injected into the process environment. There is no
name resolution between sessions. Start the callee first and pass its id to the caller
(env var, config file, or generated markup); or start the caller, then bind the port
later with `set-port`. Two services that must reference each other need one of them to
learn the other's id after the fact.

### Limitations when a session is previewed in a browser
The Hub strips `/api/v1/preview/<session_id>` before forwarding and does **not** rewrite
HTML. Your process therefore sees ordinary root-relative paths, while the browser sees
the prefix. That asymmetry is behind every problem below.

- **Absolute URLs break.** A page emitting `/assets/app.js` makes the browser resolve it
  against the Hub root, not your session — the preview renders blank. Emit
  **relative** URLs (`./assets/app.js`) and it works at any prefix, unchanged.
- **Emitting the prefix instead is not enough on its own.** Telling a dev server its
  public base is `/api/v1/preview/<id>/` fixes the HTML, but that server will then `404`
  the stripped paths the Hub forwards. Satisfying both ends needs a small reverse proxy
  on the declared port that re-adds the prefix before the dev server sees it (and relays
  `Upgrade`, or HMR dies).
- **Path-routed SPAs match no route.** The app reads `location.pathname` and gets
  `/api/v1/preview/<id>/`. Hash routing avoids this — but check the no-hash fallback:
  Heimdall's own UI falls back to the real pathname when the hash is empty
  (`src/ui/utils/appLocation.ts`), and the preview URL carries no hash, so it must be
  seeded (`location.replace(location.pathname + '#/')`) before app code runs.
- **A previewed page is same-origin with the Hub.** Its own absolute `/api/v1/...`
  requests go to the **Hub**, authenticated as the viewing user — not to your session,
  and not through any proxy your dev server configures, because those requests never
  reach your dev server at all. Use the relative `../<session_id>/` form above to address
  a session deliberately.

## shell-cmd — run a shell command on your local Bridge host
- `shell-cmd exec --cmd <command> [--cwd <dir>]` — run a shell command locally on the
  Bridge. Runs synchronously if it finishes in <15s (the response carries `status`,
  `exit_code`, `output`, and `exec_id`); if it runs >=15s it switches to async and
  returns immediately with `status:"running"` and an `exec_id` (see below).
  - `--cwd <dir>` — working directory for the command; a leading `~` is expanded and
    the directory must exist. If omitted, the command inherits the Bridge service's
    working directory (typically `$HOME`), NOT the project — so for build/test either
    pass `--cwd <project-dir>` or prefix the command with `cd <project-dir> &&`.
  - The command runs via `sh -c` with no interactive stdin, so it must be
    non-interactive (a command that waits for input will block until it is killed).
- `shell-cmd read <exec-id> [--offset <N>] [--limit <N>] [--grep <pattern>]` — fetch
  the status/output of a previously submitted exec (works while it is still running).
  - Default (no flags) returns the last 100 lines (tail), matching `exec`.
  - `--offset <N>` skips the first N lines of the output (0-indexed; default 0).
  - `--limit <N>` returns at most N lines (default 100).
  - `--grep <pattern>` returns only lines containing `<pattern>`, each prefixed with
    its original line number. Combine with `--offset`/`--limit` to page the matches.

### Async model + output truncation
- A command running >=15s returns right away with `status:"running"` and an `exec_id`;
  the Bridge keeps running it in the background and the Hub posts a chat notification
  to your conversation when it finishes. Retrieve the output any time with
  `shell-cmd read <exec_id>`.
- Output longer than 200 lines is truncated to the last 100 lines by default, with
  `truncated:true` in the response. The full, untruncated output is always on the
  Bridge filesystem at the `raw_output_location` path in the response — reach earlier
  lines with `shell-cmd read <id> --offset/--limit/--grep`.

## memory — durable memories
- `memory list [--agent-ids <id,...>] [--project-ids <id,...>] [--bridge-ids <id,...>] [--template-ids <id,...>] [--status <s>] [--type <t>] [--limit <n>]` — list memories (metadata only).
- `memory show <memory-id>` — full memory details (body + evidence).
- `memory content <memory-id>` — print the raw memory body.
- `memory propose --type <t> --title <t> [--description <t>] [--body <t>] [--evidence <t>] [--agent-ids <id,...>] [--project-ids <id,...>] [--bridge-ids <id,...>] [--template-ids <id,...>]` — propose a durable memory.

### Memory scope (FOUR dimensions — there is no `--scope` word-flag)
Scope is set by four id-list dimensions, each accepting singular/plural spellings and
either repeated flags or comma-separated values:

| Dimension | Accepted flag spellings |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| agent     | `--agent-id` / `--agent-ids` / `--agent` / `--agents` |
| project   | `--project-id` / `--project-ids` / `--project` / `--projects` |
| bridge    | `--bridge-id` / `--bridge-ids` / `--bridge` / `--bridges` |
| template  | `--template-id` / `--template-ids` / `--template` / `--templates` |

An OMITTED dimension applies broadly (to all); the agent dimension defaults to the
caller's own agent. "Global" scope = omit the scope flags. Repeatable or comma-separated:
`--project-ids proj_1,proj_2` and `--project proj_1 --project proj_2` are equivalent.

## context — instance snapshot
- `context` — one-shot snapshot of this instance: chain, current task, and unread counts.
  Takes no arguments.

## start-success — startup signal
- `start-success` — signal this instance is ready. Run once at startup; idempotent.

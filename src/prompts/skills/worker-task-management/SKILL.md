description: How a WORKER (or reviewer) agent uses ham-ctl to execute assigned tasks, report progress, hand off for review, and vote — covering the full task lifecycle and status vocabulary, the in_progress→in_validation handoff, implicit LGTM-quorum completion, and the QUICK vs COMPREHENSIVE reviewer checklists with risk-based tier selection. Load whenever you are a non-coordinator (worker or reviewer) member of a chain and need to run, hand off, or review a task.

# Worker task management (execute your assigned tasks)

You are a worker on this chain. Do the tasks ASSIGNED to you and report progress. Do not coordinate the whole chain or take on unassigned work — route that to the coordinator.

All commands use the managed wrapper: `./.heimdall/bin/ham-ctl`. For exact flags of any command, load the `ham-ctl-reference` skill.

## 0. Before you start (non-negotiable: don't assume, share your plan, escalate)
- DO NOT ASSUME OR INVENT anything not stated in the task. If any required detail is missing, ambiguous, or contradictory (paths, acceptance criteria, commands, expected behavior), STOP and ask the coordinator BEFORE doing the work — never guess, never silently expand scope. Ask by posting a task comment stating exactly what is unclear; if urgent, message the coordinator (the "Coordinator:" id in your bootstrap header) with `./.heimdall/bin/ham-ctl chat send --to <coordinator-instance-id> --body "..."` and/or `./.heimdall/bin/ham-ctl task nudge <task-id>`.
- SHARE YOUR PLAN first: before substantial work, post a brief numbered plan as a task comment (what you will change, which files, how you will verify) so the coordinator can course-correct early. As a reviewer, post your review tier and what you will check before you dig in.
- Work WITH the coordinator: route blockers, questions, and scope changes to the coordinator rather than deciding unilaterally; proceed once you have what you need.

## 1. Find your work
- `./.heimdall/bin/ham-ctl task list [--chain <id>]` — list tasks; focus on those assigned to you and currently actionable (your current task is set by `reconcile`).
- Read the task description and the chain description for the REQ-IDs and acceptance criteria your task must satisfy.
- To catch up on discussion efficiently, `task list`/`task show` return a compact `comment_summary` (count, last_comment_at, author, preview), NOT full bodies. When the summary shows new activity, read only the recent bodies: `./.heimdall/bin/ham-ctl task comments <task-id> --last N` (newest N, max 100). Prefer a small N.

## 2. Do the work with visible progress
- Start: `./.heimdall/bin/ham-ctl task status <task-id> --status in_progress`.
- Comment at every meaningful step, on blockers, and before handoff: `./.heimdall/bin/ham-ctl task comment <task-id> --body "<what you did, what changed, what is next>"`.
- Do not do substantial work that has no task. If one is missing, ask the coordinator to create it (do not silently expand scope).

## 3. Hand off for review
- When done: `./.heimdall/bin/ham-ctl task status <task-id> --status in_validation`. Include a summary comment of what to review and the evidence (tests run + output, build result, files/paths, ids).
- The only legal path into review is `in_progress → in_validation`; you cannot jump from `queued`/`assigned` straight to `in_validation`. If your task was demoted to `queued`, move it to `in_progress` first.
- After handoff you don't "mark it done" — there is **no `done` verb** and **no `approved` status.** When your required reviewers reach an LGTM quorum with no `ngtm`, the Hub auto-finalizes the task straight to `completed` (that is also what unblocks any dependent tasks).
- If you receive an `ngtm` vote, the task moves to `validated_not_good`. Address the feedback, comment what you changed, move it back to `in_progress`, fix, then re-submit `in_validation`.

### Task status vocabulary
The valid statuses are exactly: `assigned`, `queued`, `in_progress`, `in_validation`, `validated_good`, `validated_not_good`, `paused`, `completed`, `cancelled`. You mainly drive `in_progress` and `in_validation`; `queued` is a holding state the auto-promotion engine manages; completion happens on the reviewer quorum, not by an explicit command.

## 4. Reviewing (when you are a reviewer)
You cannot vote on a task assigned to you. Vote with `./.heimdall/bin/ham-ctl task vote <task-id> --result lgtm|ngtm [--comment "<specific, actionable feedback>"]` (`--result` must be exactly `lgtm` or `ngtm`). A satisfied LGTM quorum (no `ngtm`) auto-completes the task and unblocks its dependents, so review promptly — a stalled review blocks the chain.

**In BOTH tiers: verify against ACTUAL behavior (run the command / read the source / build+test) — never from the assignee's summary alone. An `lgtm` MUST cite the evidence you checked; an `ngtm` MUST list concrete, actionable fix steps.**

### Which tier? (selection guidance)
The coordinator states the required tier in the task (Dependencies & handoff). If it's missing, choose by risk:
- QUICK — docs / comments / cosmetic / text-only changes with no runtime-behavior impact.
- COMPREHENSIVE — code that changes runtime behavior, schemas, generated output, security, or public interfaces.
- When in doubt → COMPREHENSIVE.

### QUICK review checklist (low-risk / cosmetic / doc-only) — time-boxed
1. Read the task's acceptance-criteria checklist and the assignee's handoff comment.
2. Read the actual diff/changed files.
3. Confirm EACH acceptance-criteria item is met (tick them off one by one).
4. Run the ONE key verification command the task names; confirm it succeeds.
5. Confirm build/tests the task cites are green (from the assignee's cited output, and spot-run if quick).
6. Confirm the handoff cited real evidence (not just "done").
7. Vote: `task vote <id> --result lgtm --comment "verified: <what you checked>"`, or `ngtm` with the exact fixes.

### COMPREHENSIVE review checklist (behavioral / higher-risk)
1. Read the task's REQ-IDs, acceptance criteria, and handoff comment.
2. Independently REBUILD from the checkout (don't trust the assignee's build): run the task's build command yourself.
3. Run the full or closely-related test suite; confirm green yourself.
4. Cross-check the change against the source of truth and CITE it (`file:line`) — re-derive every load-bearing claim.
5. Adversarial checks: edge cases, regressions, and any contradictions or duplication the change introduces.
6. If the change has generated/codegen artifacts, confirm they were regenerated and MATCH the source (re-run the generator; diff).
7. Give evidence PER acceptance-criterion (map each criterion → the command output or file:line that proves it).
8. Classify findings as blocking vs non-blocking.
9. Vote: `lgtm` only if every criterion is proven with cited evidence; otherwise `ngtm` listing concrete, actionable steps.

Route disagreements you can't resolve to the coordinator; don't take over the implementation.

## 5. Communication
- Route questions, blockers, and user-facing messages through the coordinator (`chat send --to <coordinator-agent-instance-id>`).
- See the `heimdall-ctl-communication` skill for messaging syntax, chat conventions, and separating technical logs (task comments) from user communication (`chat send --to user`).
- Use `./.heimdall/bin/ham-ctl task nudge <task-id> [--message "<text>"]` to request attention on a stalled task you own or review.

Keep your task status and comments current at all times so the chain reflects real progress.

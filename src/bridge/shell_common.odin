// Shared bridge-side shell-session state and output helpers.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS, now that it is not what its old name said. It used to be
// src/bridge/shell_cmd.odin, the home of the `agent.shell_cmd.exec` /
// `agent.shell_cmd.read` RPCs and the direct-child run path behind them.
// REQ-SHELL-7 DELETED that surface outright — the CLI group, the two RPCs, the
// hub's /agent-actions/shell-cmd/{report,list} routes and the whole shell_jobs
// stack they reported into. What survived is everything the REPLACEMENT path calls,
// which turned out to be over half the file, so the file was renamed rather than
// deleted:
//
//   * bridge_shell_session_map        — the one process-wide session map, shared by
//                                      every kind (run, shell, server).
//   * bridge_shell_run_wait_response  — the foreground block behind
//                                      `agent.shell.wait`, i.e. `ham-ctl shell run`.
//   * bridge_shell_data_dir           — the expanded data dir, owned by the caller.
//   * bridge_shell_tail / _page       — output truncation and paging, called by the
//                                      hub-driven log handler and the wait response.
//   * bridge_shell_output_dir / _path — where a session's captured stdout lives.
//   * bridge_shell_write_session_json — the session result shape.
//   * the bridge_shell_test_* seams   — used across the bridge shell suites.
//
// WHERE A RUN IS SPAWNED NOW: bridge_hub_handle_shell_start
// (src/bridge/hub_runtime_client.odin), through the pty-host daemon, for all three
// kinds. `ham-ctl shell run` reaches it by creating the session on the hub
// (POST /api/v1/bridges/{id}/shells) and then blocking on agent.shell.wait; there is
// no bridge-local exec RPC any more.
//
// THE RULES THE DELETED PATH USED TO CARRY, and who carries them now:
//   * capturing stdout = the child's stdout+stderr are redirected into
//     <data_dir>/shell_sessions/<session_id>.out at spawn time and that file is
//     streamed on demand. UNCHANGED — pty-host is handed the same tee path
//     (bridge_shell_output_path), under REQ-SHELL-8's retention window. Output is
//     never stored in the hub.
//   * backgrounding is EXPLICIT. The caller asks with `--bg`, or converts a live run
//     from the UI; there is no duration at which a foreground run silently becomes
//     something else. The 15s BRIDGE_SHELL_ASYNC_THRESHOLD rule was deleted by
//     REQ-SHELL-2 and is not coming back.
//   * ONLY a background run notifies. That decision now lives in the HUB
//     (REQ-SHELL-5 §1, shell_session_service.odin -> _shell_session_notify_run_finished)
//     rather than in a bridge-side reaper, because the hub is the side that owns a
//     session's background flag and the agent's conversation.

// Hard cap for a run measured from spawn; exceeded -> SIGKILL the process group +
// status failed/killed. It bounds the PROCESS, not any call waiting on it, so a
// dropped waiter neither extends nor shortens it, and it applies equally to a
// foreground and a background run.
//
// It does NOT apply to kind=server sessions. A server is long-running by
// definition — capping it at 30 minutes would kill every dev server half an hour
// in. That is enforced by ARMING the watchdog for kind=Run only rather than by
// exempting servers: see bridge_shell_run_cap_start (src/bridge/shell_run_wait.odin),
// which is where the cap moved when the direct-child reaper that used to hold it was
// deleted, and whose arming decision is asserted directly in shell_run_wait_test.odin.

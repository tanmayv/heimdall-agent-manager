// REQ-SHELL-20: validation of a session's requested working directory, for every
// kind that spawns through the pty-host daemon.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL — it is compensating for a SILENT FALLBACK IN A VENDORED
// THIRD-PARTY CRATE, not re-checking something we already check. Do not "simplify"
// it away as redundant validation.
//
// The bridge hands `cwd` to pty-host (tools/pty_host/src/host.rs:122-124,
// `cmd.cwd(cwd)`), which hands it to portable-pty's CommandBuilder. That crate
// then does this, in portable-pty 0.9.0, CommandBuilder::as_command():
//
//     src/cmdbuilder.rs:501-507
//         let dir: &OsStr = self.cwd.as_ref()
//             .map(|dir| dir.as_os_str())
//             .filter(|dir| std::path::Path::new(dir).is_dir())  // DROPS a bad cwd
//             .unwrap_or(home.as_ref());                         // ...and uses $HOME
//     src/cmdbuilder.rs:526            cmd.current_dir(dir);
//
// A cwd that fails `is_dir()` is DISCARDED and replaced by the home directory, with
// nothing reported. The command then really does run in $HOME and exits 0, so the
// caller is told the run succeeded and the session row records a directory the
// process never entered.
//
// THE ASYMMETRY THIS EXPLAINS, and the reason the bug read as flakiness rather than
// as a missing check — two adjacent error cases take two different code paths:
//
//     --cwd /tmp        is_dir TRUE,  chdir ok      -> survives the filter, used. Correct.
//     --cwd /nope       stat ENOENT                 -> is_dir FALSE -> filtered -> $HOME. SILENT.
//     --cwd /etc/passwd is_dir FALSE (a file)       -> is_dir FALSE -> filtered -> $HOME. SILENT.
//     --cwd /root       is_dir TRUE,  chdir EACCES  -> SURVIVES the filter (stat only
//                                                      needs +x on the PARENT, not on
//                                                      /root itself), so the real chdir
//                                                      runs and fails inside the child
//                                                      -> spawn_command errors -> loud.
//
// `is_dir()` is a stat() predicate, so an existing-but-unenterable directory passes it
// and dies loudly at the real chdir, while a missing or non-directory path is deleted
// before chdir is ever attempted. That is why an ABSENT directory failed SILENTLY while
// a present-but-unusable one failed loudly.
//
// WHAT THIS CHECKS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. It rejects exactly the two cases
// the filter swallows: missing, and present-but-not-a-directory. It does NOT probe for
// access. EACCES is neither of those, it already fails loudly at spawn, and a probe
// would be a TOCTOU guess about the child's uid — a check that can be wrong between
// test and use is worse than the loud failure you already get.
//
// WHY BRIDGE-SIDE. The path only means anything on the machine that will spawn the
// process, so a hub-side existence check is impossible for any remote bridge and would
// validate against the wrong host's filesystem even where it happened to work.
//
// EXPANSION AND THE CHECK ARE THE SAME STEP, on purpose: checking the raw value would
// pass a literal `~/foo` that the spawn then fails to resolve. Callers store the cwd AS
// THE CALLER WROTE IT and resolve at each spawn — bridge-side and hub-side rows then
// describe a session the same way, and a future convergence check comparing them cannot
// see a spurious disagreement. Residual, already true of every cwd we store and not
// this procedure's to fix: `~` resolves against THE BRIDGE's HOME, so the stored string
// is only unambiguous on that host.
//
// A BARE `~` IS A CASE OF ITS OWN, and getting it wrong is how the first cut of this
// guard NARROWED a working input (review B1). The shared bridge_expand_home
// (src/bridge/provider_store.odin:166-173) expands only on a `~/` PREFIX, so a lone `~`
// fell through unexpanded, was stat()ed literally, and was refused with "does not
// exist: ~" — a refusal that is FALSE about the world, since the directory `~` names
// exists on every host we run on. It is also the one input where the pre-fix fallback to
// $HOME was RIGHT, and right for the right reason: $HOME is exactly what `~` denotes. So
// `~` and `~/…` are BOTH expanded here.
//
// EXPANDED HERE, NOT BY WIDENING bridge_expand_home: that helper is shared with the
// provider store and the data dir, and changing shared expansion semantics is out of
// this contract's scope. Doing it locally also makes the HOME-UNSET branch explicit
// rather than a silent fall-through — with no HOME there is no answer, so both `~` and
// `~/x` are refused saying THAT, instead of claiming a path does not exist. A `~user`
// form is deliberately NOT expanded: nothing in this product has ever resolved one, so
// it is checked literally and refused naming what was checked.

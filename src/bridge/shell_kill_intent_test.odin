// REQ-SHELL-3 bridge-side tests — the DELIVERY half of durable kill intent:
//   AC3  a kill DELIVERED TWICE is a no-op the second time
//   AC4  a kill whose target already exited signals nothing, including the PID-REUSE
//        case (target exited, pid reassigned: nothing is signalled)
//   §5b  a kill that arrives BEFORE the session exists is recorded, not dropped, and
//        is applied exactly once when the spawn produces a pid
//
// WHAT THESE TESTS DELIBERATELY DO NOT DO: arm a real kill worker. Arming calls
// bridge_pty_host_ensure_daemon, which SPAWNS the pty-host daemon (or attaches to the
// live one on this host) and then signals it — a side effect on the developer's
// machine that a unit test has no business having, and one that would make the
// assertions depend on a daemon's state rather than on this code. Every test below
// therefore asserts the DECISION that precedes arming, which is where all of the new
// logic lives; the arming sequence itself is unchanged code, extracted verbatim into
// bridge_shell_kill_arm.

// THE DEFECT THESE PIN DOWN. A kill accepted while the bridge was offline is redelivered
// by the hub on reconnect, and it arrives BEFORE reconcile has rebuilt the session map
// from the surviving pty-host daemon's roster. It therefore always found an empty map,
// took the kill-before-start branch above, and was parked as an intent — which nothing
// ever consumed, because the only consumer was the spawn path and a bridge that restarts
// does not SPAWN the sessions it inherits, it ADOPTS them. The process outlived a kill the
// hub had already promised the user, and no log on the host said so.
//
// WHY THEY FAIL BEFORE THE FIX. Not by a changed assertion but by a missing mechanism:
// before REQ-SHELL-23 nothing outside bridge_hub_handle_shell_start consumed an intent at
// all, so "the adopted, still-live session is armed from its parked intent" was unreachable
// by any path. The pre-existing §5b tests above still pass unchanged and are still right —
// they are simply about the other reason a session can be missing from the map, and that
// difference is the whole point of the age gate below.

// REQ-SHELL-4: a shell_exited outbox that survives a BRIDGE RESTART.
//
// The in-memory queue in hub_runtime_client.odin already survives a DISCONNECT —
// bridge_shell_exited_drain_outgoing re-queues the item at the head on send failure
// and marks the connection dead, so the exit drains on reconnect. What it did not
// survive was the bridge process going away: the queue was a plain [dynamic] array,
// so a restart with queued exits left the hub showing those sessions as running
// forever, with nothing but a client poll to ever correct it.
//
// This file gives that queue a disk backing, modelled on the spec store in
// bridge_shell_session.odin (atomic .tmp + rename, one JSON file per entry) because
// that is the persistence idiom this package already uses.
//
// DELIVERY CONTRACT — at-least-once, never at-most-once.
// The file is removed only AFTER the frame is handed to the WS successfully. A crash
// in the window between the send and the remove replays that exit on the next boot.
// That is deliberate: losing an exit strands a session as "running" forever, while
// repeating one is harmless because the hub's apply is idempotent
// (shell_session_handle_exited returns early on an already-terminal row). We take
// the duplicate over the loss.
//
// ORDER is explicitly NOT guaranteed across a restart: entries reload sorted by the
// moment they were enqueued, but a replayed exit can still arrive after a newer,
// more accurate terminal status reached the hub by another route. The hub's terminal
// guard is what makes that safe — the bridge does not try to order its way out of it.

// BRIDGE_SHELL_EXITED_OUTBOX_MAX_AGE_MS bounds how long an undeliverable exit is
// kept before it is dropped (REQ-SHELL-4 §4). An exit whose session no longer
// exists hub-side — the row was deleted, or the hub's DB was reset — can never be
// applied, and without a bound it would be re-sent on every reconnect for the life
// of the machine.
//
// 24h is chosen to be comfortably longer than any plausible hub outage that is
// still worth converging after: past a day the session's status is of no
// operational interest to anyone, and the honest answer is that it is gone rather
// than a resurrected row appearing in a list days later.

// BRIDGE_SHELL_EXITED_OUTBOX_MAX_ENTRIES bounds the queue by COUNT as well, so a

// entries are dropped: the newest exits are the ones a user is most likely still
// watching for.

// bridge_shell_exited_outbox_dir returns the outbox directory. The result is ALWAYS

// bridge_shell_exited_outbox_file_name maps a RUN to its envelope's file name.
//
// KEYED BY (session_id, run_seq), NOT BY session_id ALONE. The key is what makes the
// store deduplicating — one envelope per run, so a reconcile racing the pty-host's
// own ChildExited overwrites rather than queueing a second frame — and getting its
// GRANULARITY wrong is worse than having no dedup at all:
//
// A session_id is NOT a run. shell_session_restart re-spawns under the same
// session_id. Key by session alone and run #1's exit, queued while the bridge was
// offline, sits on disk under the same name the restarted session would use, is
// still there when the bridge reconnects, and is delivered against a row that is
// LEGITIMATELY RUNNING — the hub marks a live session terminal on the strength of a
// previous run's exit. Deduplication makes that entry LINGER, so keying too coarsely
// raises the odds of the divergence rather than lowering them.
//
// Keying by the run keeps the dedup and removes the confusion: the stale entry is a
// separate file, and the hub discards it on arrival because its run_seq is older
// than the row's.
//
// Session ids are minted by the bridge and are already [A-Za-z0-9_], but this is a
// path built from a value that also arrives over the wire, so anything outside that
// set is replaced rather than trusted — a session_id of "../x" must not be able to

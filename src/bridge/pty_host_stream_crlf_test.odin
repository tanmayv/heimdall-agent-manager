// REQ-SHELL-31: the BRIDGE's catch-up snapshot joined rows with a bare LF — the SECOND
// staircase producer. REQ-SHELL-30 fixed the hub's snapshot builder, the terminal still
// staircased, and this emit site (pty_host_stream_worker.odin, the .Screen case) was why:
// it writes the joined screen into a `shell_pty_output` data_b64 frame, which lands in
// xterm as RAW BYTES. LF without CR drops a row and keeps the column.
//
// WHAT THESE TESTS PROVE, STATED EXACTLY: that bridge_pty_stream_screen_payload — the join plus
// the conversion, the SAME composition the .Screen emit site uses — emits exactly one "\r\n" per
// row boundary, never "\r\n\r\n", and never a trailing separator after the last row.
//
// WHAT THEY DO NOT PROVE: xterm.js's deferred-wrap cancellation — that writing
// the cols-th character sets a pending wrap which a following CR cancels, so CRLF after a
// genuinely full-width row yields one newline rather than two. That is terminal-emulator
// behaviour, it cannot be executed from an Odin unit test, and it is the USER'S re-check.
// It is not measured here and must not be reported as if it were.
//
// Nor do they prove anything about xterm's `convertEol`, which is what makes the SAME bare-LF
// text correct on the polled panes (ShellTerminalPane.tsx:229/:349). These tests cover the
// streaming path only, where convertEol is off — which is precisely the path that was broken.

// bridge_pty_stream_screen_payload is the SECOND catch-up producer. The hub's polled repaint
// (_shell_screen_repaint_text) already ended its payload with a CUP built from the pane's real
// cursor; this one ended at the last written byte, so the cursor landed at end-of-text instead
// of its true cell. Trimming trailing blank rows — added just above — moves end-of-text further
// from the cursor and widens the gap, which is why both producers now have to agree.

// that a coordinate below zero suppresses the sequence rather than producing a guessed position.
//
// WHAT THEY DO NOT PROVE: that xterm then parks the caret in that cell, nor that the pty-host's
// reported coordinates match what the real shell believes. Those are emulator and pty-host
// behaviour, not reachable from an Odin unit test, and are the user's re-check.

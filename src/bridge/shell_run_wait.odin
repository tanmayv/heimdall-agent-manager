// REQ-SHELL-2: the bridge-local wait that makes a FOREGROUND run block.
//
// WHY THIS IS BRIDGE-LOCAL AND NOT A LONG HUB REQUEST (coordinator ruling on
// item 0). The description asked for a foreground run to block its caller until
// the run reaches a terminal status. The transport cannot carry that as one HTTP
// request: ham-ctl -> bridge local endpoint -> hub all use
// http.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS = 20_000 (src/lib/http_client/http_client.odin:11), so a
// 30-minute blocking POST is cut at 20s at two hops, and holding it hub-side
// would pin a hub request thread for the length of the run. Polling is forbidden
// outright by the chain.
//
// So the create stays fast over the existing endpoint, and the BLOCK is a second,
// purely local call — `agent.shell.wait` — served by the bridge that owns the
// process. The bridge already receives the exit event, so the wait is a condvar
// signalled by that event with no hub round trip and no poller anywhere.
//
// FOUR CONSTRAINTS this file exists to satisfy, all of them required:
//
//   W1  The long timeout is on THAT ONE CALL. Nothing here changes
//       DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS or any shared client path — a wait is bounded by the
//       timeout_ms the caller passes, capped at BRIDGE_SHELL_WAIT_MAX_MS.
//
//   W2  THE WAIT IS A CONVENIENCE, NEVER THE SOURCE OF TRUTH. Every piece of
//       state a run has lives in the session map and its on-disk spec. A waiter
//       owns nothing: if ham-ctl dies, is Ctrl-C'd, or the local call times out,
//       the run keeps running, stays in the map, keeps its spec, stays killable
//       by id and stays reapable by reconcile. Dropping a waiter is invisible to
//       the process. This is why the registry below is keyed by session id and
//       holds no process handle — there is deliberately nothing here to lose.
//
//   W3  ONE EXIT EVENT, TWO CONSUMERS. Signalling a waiter must never consume or
//       starve the hub notification path (T4/T5). bridge_shell_wait_signal_exit
//       is therefore purely ADDITIVE at every call site: it is called alongside
//       the existing bridge_shell_exited_enqueue, never instead of it, and it
//       returns nothing the caller branches on. A run with no waiter at all
//       behaves exactly as it did before this file existed.
//
//   W4  The 30-minute hard cap (BRIDGE_SHELL_HARD_TIMEOUT) is enforced on the
//       PROCESS, not here. A waiter timing out does not kill anything, and a
//       dropped waiter neither extends nor shortens the cap.

// Ceiling on a single wait call. Slightly above BRIDGE_SHELL_HARD_TIMEOUT so a
// foreground caller that asks for "as long as it takes" outlives the process cap
// and always gets a real terminal answer rather than a wait timeout — the cap
// kills the process, the exit signal wakes the waiter, and the caller learns it
// was killed. It is a ceiling on the CALL only (W1/W4); it bounds nothing about
// the process.

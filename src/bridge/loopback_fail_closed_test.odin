// AUDIT F4: the loopback surface must FAIL CLOSED when the bridge has no credential.
//
// WHAT THE DEFECT WAS. `bridge_loopback_authorized` opened with:
//
//     if strings.trim_space(bridge_config.bridge_token) == "" do return true
//
// A blank configured token authorised EVERY loopback request. That is not a narrow
// edge case — a bridge is token-less for its whole life before it enrols, and a
// bridge whose token file is missing, empty or unreadable is token-less too. In all
// of those states the loopback routes, which spawn agents and read project files,
// were open to any local process with no credential at all.
//
// WHY IT COULD ONLY BE FLIPPED WITH THE STATIC-TOKEN DELETION. The permissive branch
// had exactly one legitimate consumer: a locally started bridge deliberately given
// no token, which is how the deleted static-token path let a developer run a stack
// without enrolling. Flipping it sooner would have broken every such bridge,
// including other agents' running `dev-stack.sh` harnesses. REQ-IMPL-6 deletes that
// path and rewrites `dev-stack.sh` onto the device flow, so nothing legitimate
// depends on fail-open any more.
//
// WHY THESE TESTS EXIST RATHER THAN A COMMENT. F4 is a privilege-escalation defect,
// and settled practice in this chain is that a security property without a test
// proving it is an `ngtm`. Reintroducing the `return true` makes
// `test_blank_configured_token_authorizes_nothing` fail, which is the whole point.

// The blank check was trimmed but the equality check was not, so a token supplied

// whitespace passed the blank test and then rejected every correctly-formed request
// — a bridge silently refusing its own traffic. (`bridge_read_token_file` already
// trims, so the token-file path never hit this.) The two checks must agree on what

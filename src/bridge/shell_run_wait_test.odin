// REQ-SHELL-2 bridge-side acceptance tests: the deleted 15s threshold, explicit
// backgrounding, the runtime foreground->background conversion, and reconcile's
// direct-child liveness rule.
//
// REQ-SHELL-7 REMOVED THIS SUITE'S ORIGINAL SPAWN SEAM. These tests were written
// against the bridge-local exec RPC, which was the only producer of a DIRECT-CHILD
// (pty_host=false) session. That RPC and its whole surface are gone, so:
//
//   * The cases that asserted the RPC's own RETURN SHAPE — a foreground call coming
//     back inline, --bg returning a session id at once, the spec being cleared when
//     the run ends — were deleted with it. The same properties on the surviving path
//     are covered by the bridge_shell_run_wait_response cases below, which is what
//     `ham-ctl shell run` actually blocks on.
//   * The two cases that asserted the bridge-side "only a background run notifies"
//     decision were deleted too: that decision no longer exists here. The rule now
//     lives in the hub (REQ-SHELL-5 §1, _shell_session_notify_run_finished) and is
//     asserted in src/hub/service/shell_session/shell_session_req5_test.odin.
//   * THE RECONCILE CASES WERE PORTED, NOT DELETED, because the branch they test
//     SURVIVES: a bridge upgraded past REQ-SHELL-7 still reads direct-child specs
//     written before it, so bridge_shell_session_reconcile must still resolve them.
//     Deleting the producer must not delete the reader's test. They now spawn the
//     child through test_spawn_direct_child_run below, which reproduces exactly what
//     the retired RPC did: setsid + sh -c, output teed to the session's .out file,
//     pty_host=false, spec written after the pid is known.

// test_spawn_direct_child_run spawns a DIRECT-CHILD run and registers it exactly as
// the retired bridge-local exec RPC did, so the reconcile tests below still exercise
// the pty_host=false branch after REQ-SHELL-7 removed that RPC.
//
// It is a faithful port, not a convenient approximation, and three details carry the
// test's weight:
//   * setsid + sh -c on Linux. bridge_shell_session_pid_is_plausible matches the ps
//     `command=` basename against the spec cmd, and it is the exec chain through sh
//     that makes ps report "sleep 30" for the recorded pid. Spawning sleep directly
//     would pass for a different reason than production does.
//   * started_at is stamped from the same clock, because plausibility also requires
//     ps lstart to be within 5s of it.
//   * SPEC FIRST, THEN REGISTER, and every string cloned from THE MAP'S allocator:
//     save_spec reads the strings the map is about to own, and under `odin test`
//     context.allocator is a per-test tracking allocator while the map's is the
//     process heap (REQ-SHELL-11).

// path, and with it both the decision and the counter. The rule itself did not move

// (REQ-SHELL-5 §1, shell_session_service.odin -> _shell_session_notify_run_finished)

// A test asserting the rule in a layer that no longer owns it would be asserting
// history, so it is not re-created here.

// ---- legacy specs of UNKNOWN provenance -----------------------------------

// The coordinator's question, answered as a test rather than as reasoning.
//
// A spec written BEFORE REQ-SHELL-2 has no pty_host key. If that loaded as a
// plain `false`, a genuinely pty-host-spawned session would take the direct-child
// path and the roster that correctly tracks it would never be consulted — and
// pid_is_plausible can legitimately fail for such a process (the recorded pid is
// the pty-host's child, and ps identifies it by a cmd basename that need not match
// the spec's). The safety net would then declare a LIVE session dead.
//
// THE PATH WAS REAL, just not where it was first expected: it is reached through
// the ORPHAN branch, not the in-map branch. After a restart the map is empty, so a
// legacy spec goes to "not in map" — which before this fix meant the roster was
// never consulted for it at all, a REGRESSION against the pre-REQ-SHELL-2
// behaviour, where every spec was matched against the roster first.
//
// Fix, as the coordinator specified: unknown provenance consults the ROSTER FIRST
// and falls back to the direct-child rule only on a miss. A roster hit is strictly

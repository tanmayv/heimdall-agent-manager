// Tests for bridge-side reassembly of chunked hub->bridge commands (REQ-SHELL-36).
//
// Three things are being proven, and the third is the one the chain's core invariant
// depends on:
//   1. ROUND TRIP — an ordered chunk sequence rebuilds the original command exactly.
//   2. HOSTILE/MALFORMED INPUT is dropped without dispatching and without allocating an
//      unbounded buffer.
//   3. ALL-OR-NOTHING — an INTERRUPTED sequence (the reconnect case) never dispatches a
//      partial command, and the partial dies with the connection rather than lingering.

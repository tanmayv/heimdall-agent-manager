// REQ-CLI-1: `agent.task_chain.publish` route mapping.
//
// A coordinator agent could build a well-formed chain and never start it: chains
// and tasks are created publish_state=draft, draft tasks cannot be nudged and are
// never promoted, and there was no agent-surface method to publish. The hub route
// (POST /api/v1/task-chains/<id>/publish) and its coordinator permission check
// already existed — these tests pin the bridge surface that reaches them.

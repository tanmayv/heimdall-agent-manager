// daemon on reconnect. shell_cmd.odin uses this as the backing store for
// shell-cmd exec/read (kind=Command); T4 WS handlers will add Agent/Interactive/

// allocator is the ONE allocator every entry's strings are allocated from and
// freed through, and it is carried on the map rather than taken from
// context.allocator for the reason lsp_session.odin's lsp_heap already states:
// this state crosses threads. A session is registered on the WS command thread,
// re-registered by reconcile on a background thread, and freed by whichever
// thread supersedes or removes the key — while context.allocator differs per
// thread (it is a per-test tracking allocator under `odin test`), so letting it
// decide means freeing through a different allocator than allocated from.
//
// A zero value means "not set yet" and resolves to runtime.default_allocator(),
// so the process-wide bridge_shell_session_map needs no initialisation. A test
// may set it to a mem.Tracking_Allocator before first use to assert the
// ownership rule holds (shell_session_ownership_test.odin does exactly that).
Bridge_Shell_Session_Map :: struct {
	mu:        sync.Mutex,
	sessions:  map[string]Bridge_Shell_Session, // keyed by session_id
	allocator: runtime.Allocator,

//
// OWNERSHIP RULE (REQ-SHELL-11). THE MAP OWNS every string of every entry it
// holds, and nothing outside the map may point into that allocation once the map
// mutex is released. There is therefore NO by-value getter: reading a session
// gives you memory whose ownership is unambiguous, in one of three shapes.
//
//   bridge_shell_session_scalars   — the string-free fields, copied under the
//                                    lock. No allocation, nothing to free.
//                                    PREFER THIS: a snapshot where scalars would
//                                    do is a needless clone.
//   bridge_shell_session_shell_id  — the daemon key, CLONED under the lock.
//                                    Release with bridge_shell_session_str_delete.
//   bridge_shell_session_snapshot  — the whole record, DEEP-CLONED under the
//                                    lock. Release with
//                                    bridge_shell_session_snapshot_destroy.
//
// That mirrors the hub side, where domain.shell_session_destroy /
// domain.shell_sessions_destroy already state the same rule for the same record.
//
// WHY, i.e. what this replaced. The old API returned Bridge_Shell_Session BY
// VALUE, so every caller walked away with borrowed pointers into the stored
// allocation while the mutex was already released. That forced register to LEAK
// the strings it superseded: freeing them would have raced any holder — the
// kill/signal handlers in hub_runtime_client.odin read sess.shell_id across a
// bridge_pty_host_ensure_daemon call that can block for up to 5s, while reconcile
// re-registers the same session from a background thread — a use-after-free with a
// seconds-wide window. With no borrowed pointers left, that free is correct, and
// bridge_shell_session_register performs it.
//
// The teardown discipline is AGENTS.md's "Socket lifetime across threads" applied
// to this map: whoever removes the key owns the free, it happens under the same
// lock that removed it, and a thread that loses that race never dereferences the
// pointer because it never held one.

// Bridge_Shell_Session_Scalars is every field of Bridge_Shell_Session that is NOT
// a string. Copying it out of the map is a plain value copy, so a caller that only
// needs status/pid/kind/port/exit/background allocates nothing and frees nothing.

// bridge_shell_session_register inserts (or replaces) a session, CONSUMING it: it

// caller's copy cannot be read afterwards. Those strings MUST come from the map's
// allocator (bridge_shell_session_map_allocator) — this is the proc that will
// eventually free them.
//
// WHY IT TAKES A POINTER AND ZEROES (REQ-SHELL-11 review). Handing a struct to the
// map and then reading it again is the WRITE-SIDE version of the borrow this task
// removed from the read side, and it is the more dangerous half: the hazard is not
// this register freeing your strings, it is the NEXT register of the same session_id
// making your just-handed-over set the superseded one and freeing it while you are
// still reading. Five call sites did exactly that.
//   Odin has no move semantics, so "the caller's copy stops compiling" is not
// available. Taking `^Bridge_Shell_Session` is the closest thing: the call reads as a
// transfer at every site, and a post-register read now yields the ZERO VALUE — an
// empty id or a .Starting status that fails immediately and visibly — instead of a
// silent read of memory another thread may have freed.
//   THE ZEROING IS NOT SUFFICIENT ON ITS OWN, and callers must not treat it as a
// licence: a copy made BEFORE the call (`updated := s`, the reconcile shape) still
// aliases the same string data, and zeroing `updated` does nothing for `s`. Those
// sites clone what they need before registering. See the writer-side table in the
// task handoff.
//
// Replacing an entry FREES the strings the previous entry owned, which is only
// correct because no getter hands out a pointer into them (see the OWNERSHIP RULE
// above). Two non-obvious guards make it safe:
//
//  1. THE KEY ALIASES THE OLD ENTRY'S session_id. Odin keeps the EXISTING key when
//     you assign to a slot that is already occupied, so `m.sessions[s.session_id] = s`
//     would leave the map keyed by the old allocation and freeing it would dangle
//     the key. delete_key first, then insert, so the new key is the new allocation.
//  2. A RE-REGISTER MAY ALIAS. If a caller ever hands back a struct sharing a string
//     with the stored entry, freeing the old copy would free memory the new entry
//     still holds. Each field is therefore freed only when its data pointer DIFFERS
//     from the new entry's, which makes an aliasing re-register a no-op rather than a
//     double free.

// ---- pending kill intents (REQ-SHELL-3) ----------------------------------
//
// A kill can arrive for a session this bridge does not know yet. The hub creates the
// row and then sends shell_start, so a kill accepted in between is dispatched
// against a session_id that is not in the map: before this, that kill was dropped on
// the floor and the process leaked the moment it spawned (the task's edge case C).
// The intent is recorded here instead and applied by one of its two consumers — the
// spawn path, the moment a spawn produces a pid, or reconcile's resolver, for a session
// adopted rather than spawned. A session that starts while carrying a kill intent is
// killed immediately, never left running.
//
// IN MEMORY, NOT ON DISK, and that is deliberate. The DURABLE store for a kill
// intent is the hub's shell_sessions.kill_requested_at column, and the hub re-issues
// every outstanding intent when this bridge's WS reconnects — which is exactly what
// happens after a bridge restart. Persisting the set here as well would be a second
// source of truth for the same fact, with its own staleness and its own clearing
// rule, to cover a window the hub already covers.
//
// AN ENTRY IS A CANDIDATE, NOT A DECISION (REQ-SHELL-23). The recording site cannot
// tell the two reasons a session is missing from the map apart:
//
//   NOT STARTED YET  — the hub wrote its row and the spawn has not landed. The intent
//                      is meaningful and shell_start consumes it.
//   ALREADY GONE, or ADOPTED-BUT-NOT-YET-KNOWN — a stale id, a session from a previous
//                      bridge life, or (the REQ-SHELL-23 case) a session that is alive
//                      in the surviving pty-host daemon while this freshly restarted
//                      bridge has not yet rebuilt its map from the roster.
//
// Distinguishing them needs the pty-host roster, and the recording site runs on the
// hub-WS loop thread, where a daemon round-trip (up to 5s on a cold daemon) would stall
// heartbeats and every other command. So this site does not try: it records a candidate
// and RECONCILE resolves it, because reconcile is the one place that already holds the
// authoritative roster. See bridge_shell_kill_intent_resolve.
//
// THAT ALSO GIVES EVERY ENTRY AN OWNER THAT FREES IT. Before REQ-SHELL-23 the only
// consumer was the spawn path, so an intent for a session that never spawns — a stale
// id, or the reconnect case above — leaked one key for the life of the process, for any
// session id the hub ever named. The resolver retires those.
//
// recorded_at is a MONOTONIC instant and it is load-bearing, not diagnostics: the
// resolver must not judge an intent that was recorded AFTER it captured its roster,
// because such an intent may be about a spawn that has not happened yet, and discarding
// it would reintroduce exactly the leak the kill-before-start path exists to prevent.

// bridge_shell_kill_intent_resolve settles every kill intent the roster can speak for,
// and it is the second consumer the intent set never had (REQ-SHELL-23).
//
// THE DEFECT IT FIXES. A kill accepted while the bridge was offline is redelivered by the
// hub on reconnect, and it arrives BEFORE reconcile has rebuilt the session map from the
// pty-host roster — the hub replays inline on its WS accept path, while the bridge
// repopulates on a background thread whose first act can block for up to 5s spawning the
// daemon. The kill therefore always found an empty map, was parked as an intent, and was
// never consumed, because the only consumer was the spawn path and an adopted session is
// never re-spawned. The process survived a kill the hub had already promised the user,
// and nothing anywhere said so.
//
// CALLED FROM RECONCILE, with the roster already applied to the map, because that is the
// only place in the bridge that knows which sessions actually exist. `cutoff` is the
// instant the roster was captured: intents recorded at or after it are LEFT ALONE, since
// they may name a spawn that has not happened yet and discarding one would reintroduce
// the kill-before-start leak (REQ-SHELL-3 work item 5b). Taking that snapshot BEFORE the
// roster read, not after, is what makes the guard conservative in the safe direction.
//
// Each resolved intent ends in exactly one of three states, and all three FREE the entry:
//   in the map, still live     -> take + arm the kill. The REQ-SHELL-23 case.
//   in the map, terminal       -> take + drop. Already dead; re-signalling a terminal
//                                 session is the PID-reuse hazard the kill path refuses.
//   not in the map, and OLD    -> take + drop as garbage. See the age gate's reasoning.
//   not in the map, and young  -> LEFT PARKED, untouched, for the spawn path.
//
// WHY THE UNKNOWN CASE NEEDS AN AGE GATE AND NOT JUST `cutoff`. The cutoff orders an
// intent against the ROSTER, but the hazard is an intent racing a FUTURE SPAWN, which the
// roster cannot see:
//     intent recorded at T-1 (kill-before-start: the hub sent the kill before the start)
//     roster captured at T; the intent is older, so it is judged
//     not in the map -> discarded as garbage
//     shell_start lands at T+1 -> spawns -> nothing left to consume -> the process runs on
// That is exactly the leak work item 5b exists to prevent, reintroduced by a cleanup. So
// "not in the roster" is NOT sufficient grounds to discard; only "not in the roster AND too
// old for any start to still be in flight" is.

// Every unrecognised spelling is COERCED to .Run, the kind with no scope prerequisites

// The retired vocabulary — "agent", "command", "interactive" — takes the same default as
// genuine garbage would, so nothing here distinguishes a stale client from a malformed
// frame, and nothing here reports either.
//
// That is acceptable only because the real gate is upstream: the hub validates kind
// before it ever reaches the wire (domain.shell_session_validate_scope), so a retired
// spelling cannot arrive on this path in the first place. This default exists so a
// malformed frame does not crash the bridge, and for no other reason. It is not a
// parsing policy, and it must not be read as one — in particular it is NOT a
// bridge-side check on the kind vocabulary.

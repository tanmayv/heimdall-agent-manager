// REQ-SHELL-4 bridge-side acceptance tests — the half of AC1 that lives here:
// "kill a bridge with queued exits, restart it, and the hub converges without any
// client polling."
//
// A bridge RESTART cannot be staged inside a test process, so what is staged is the
// thing a restart actually does to this subsystem: the in-memory queue ceases to
// exist and the only surviving state is the filesystem. Every test below writes
// through the real persistence path, then reads back through the real load path with
// nothing carried across in memory — which is exactly the boundary a restart draws.
// The convergence that follows is the existing drain in bridge_hub_runtime_loop, and
// it is unchanged by this task, so the claim these tests support is precisely
// "restored to the queue", not "delivered".
//
// NO POLLING is asserted structurally rather than behaviourally: the restore path
// appends to the queue the WS loop already drains every tick, so there is no timer,
// no thread and no interval anywhere in this file or in shell_exited_outbox.odin.

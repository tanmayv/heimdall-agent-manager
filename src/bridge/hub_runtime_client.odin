// BRIDGE_WRAPPER_STALE_MS is how long an ACTIVE instance may go without any
// liveness signal before the bridge reconciles it to "unreachable". In the
// pty-host runtime, per-child liveness is proven by the daemon's pushed
// Host_Heartbeat digest (HOST_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 30s in the Rust daemon), NOT
// by pane activity — so an alive-but-idle agent, or one that legitimately takes
// several seconds before calling start-success, stays fresh. Kept at 3x the
// 30s digest cadence so a couple of missed digests (a briefly busy daemon or an
// event-connection reconnect) never falsely reap a live agent; only a genuinely
// gone child/daemon crosses this window (and ChildExited reaps that instantly).

// bridge_hub_connection_teardown ends one hub connection: it retires every PTY stream

//
// WHY A WRAPPER RATHER THAN TWO STATEMENTS AND A COMMENT (REQ-SHELL-40). The ordering
// is load-bearing: `ws.close` does not take the send mutex REQ-SHELL-32 added, so a
// stream worker can be inside `bridge_hub_send` at the moment the fd is closed. Running
// the teardown FIRST means that once it returns no worker is eligible to write at all,
// which shrinks that window instead of widening it. But an ordering that lives in the
// sequence of two statements at a call site is only as durable as the next reader's
// attention — and a reordering would keep every test in the suite green, because the
// unit tests can assert what the teardown DOES without a live WS and cannot assert WHEN
// it is called relative to a close.
//
// So the ordering is made unrepresentable instead of documented. There is no `ws.close`
// left in the reconnect path to reorder; both halves sit in one procedure, adjacent, with
// the reason between them. This is the same conclusion REQ-SHELL-32 reached about its
// send mutex — the lock belonged inside `ws.send_text` rather than with the callers who
// had to remember it, because caller-side discipline is exactly what had failed.
//
// Safe on every path, including the two that never had a live connection: the teardown
// returns 0 and logs nothing when there are no workers, and `ws.close` is guarded by
// `conn.connected` and is therefore idempotent.

// bridge_hub_handle_tunnel_close may have freed it.  Whoever removes the map key is the sole

// THE FD — NOT covered by that probe, and it must not be.  THIS THREAD is the sole closer
// of the socket, on every exit path, whether or not it won the key race.  Teardown on the
// WS-reader thread only shutdown(.Receive)s to wake us; it must never net.close.  Two
// reasons, both measured:
//   - close() cannot unblock a recv that is already parked: the parked recv holds the
//     struct file, so the socket is merely orphaned and this thread would sleep forever.
//     That leaked one thread per teardown, unbounded, and pinned each orphaned socket.
//   - if this thread is instead BETWEEN recv calls (in the base64/JSON section below) when
//     the close lands, its next recv_tcp re-resolves the fd NUMBER, which a new connection
//     may already own — and we would forward a stranger's bytes as tunnel_data under this
//     dead stream_id.
// Deciding the close by 'did I win the key race' is what made the fd leak possible, so the
// close below is deliberately unconditional and sits outside that branch.

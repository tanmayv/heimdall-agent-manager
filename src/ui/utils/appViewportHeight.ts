/**
 * appViewportHeight — drive the app shell's height from the VISUAL viewport.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * REQ-KBD-2. Root cause established on device in REQ-KBD-1 (artifact
 * `art_18db9abe5a639a40` §1): on iOS a software keyboard shrinks only the VISUAL
 * viewport. `window.innerHeight` — and therefore `100dvh`, `100lvh` and `100vh` —
 * does not move. Measured in the installed home-screen app with the keyboard up:
 *
 *     innerHeight = 812   visualViewport.height = 409   visualOffsetTop = 0
 *
 * The shell was sized `100dvh`, so its bottom edge stayed nailed at 812 while the
 * visible region collapsed to 0..409. The composer sat at 540..776 — entirely inside
 * the invisible 403px. Scrolling cannot rescue a box whose container's bottom edge is
 * pinned to a viewport the keyboard never shrinks.
 *
 * The fix is to stop sizing the shell from a viewport unit and size it from
 * `visualViewport.height` instead, published as the CSS custom property
 * `--app-viewport-height` on `<html>`. Everything that used to say `100dvh` says
 * `var(--app-viewport-height)`; the shell then ends where the keyboard begins and the
 * browser's own scroll-into-view does the rest.
 *
 * Two requirements below are NOT obvious and are both load-bearing. They come from
 * measurement, not taste. Read the comments before changing either.

 * REQ-VIEWPORT-SWEEP-1: the companion property, for boxes pinned to the BOTTOM edge.
 *
 * A `position: fixed` box resolves `bottom` against the LAYOUT viewport, so `bottom: 0`
 * puts its lower edge at `innerHeight` — 812 on the REQ-KBD-1 device, while the visible
 * region ended at 409. That is the same defect as `height: 100dvh`, in a spelling none of
 * the height greps can see: there is no `vh`, no `h-screen` and no `innerHeight` in
 * `fixed inset-x-0 bottom-0`. It put the app's entire mobile tab bar, every toast viewport
 * and the mobile sticky action bars at 758..814 — not clipped, fully past the fold.
 *
 * This property is how far up from the layout viewport's bottom edge such a box must sit:
 * the occluded height. See `appViewportBottomOffsetFrom` for why it is NOT `100lvh - var()`.

 * REQUIREMENT 1 — RE-READ ON A SETTLING TICK, NOT ONLY ON EVENTS.
 *
 * `visualViewport` events on this surface fire only MID-TRANSIENT. The complete event
 * log for one keyboard raise (REQ-KBD-1 §3) is two events at `10:10:03.180/.181`, both
 * taken while the viewport was still moving; the SETTLED state then held for SIX SECONDS
 * and fired nothing at all. `window.resize` never fired once. An event-only listener
 * latches the transient and never sees the steady state — that is precisely the defect
 * that made the former `useKeyboardInset()` hook report 0 forever (deleted in REQ-KBD-3).
 *
 * So every event schedules a ladder of re-reads after itself, AND a standing poll runs
 * regardless of whether any event ever arrives. Writes are suppressed when the value is
 * unchanged (see `installAppViewportHeightSync`), which is what makes the poll free: the
 * steady state costs two property reads and an integer compare per tick.

 * ranged **-111 to +466** for one physically constant 403px keyboard, and that formula
 * produced **40 distinct values** (0, 41, 99, 105, 127, 221, …, 403, …, 456) — because

/**
 * How far above the layout viewport's bottom edge the visible region ends, in CSS pixels —
 * i.e. the occluded height. `0` whenever nothing is occluding.
 *
 * WHY THIS AND NOT `calc(100lvh - var(--app-viewport-height))`, which needs no JS at all:
 * `lvh` is the LARGE viewport, the one with browser chrome RETRACTED, and it is a STATIC
 * unit — it does not move when the keyboard opens and it does not move when chrome
 * retracts mid-session. In a standalone PWA (the surface REQ-KBD-1 measured) there is no
 * retractable chrome, so `100lvh == innerHeight` and the two agree. In TABBED Safari,
 * `100lvh > innerHeight` by the chrome height permanently, so `100lvh - visible` overstates
 * the offset and floats the bar above where it belongs. Tabbed Safari is on REQ-KBD-1's
 * NOT-MEASURED list, so the `lvh` spelling would be correct only on the surface we happened
 * to measure. Subtracting within one sample cannot diverge from the height the shell is
 * already sized by, because it is the same number minus the same number.
 *
 * This is NOT a second sampler: it takes the same `AppViewportReading` and calls
 * `appViewportHeightFrom`. That also makes pinch-zoom fall out for free — there the height
 * function returns `innerHeight`, so the offset is exactly 0 and nothing is displaced.
 *
 * Like `app-shell`'s own `top-0` + `height: var(--app-viewport-height)`, this is exact while
 * `visualViewport.offsetTop` is 0 (measured 0 on the REQ-KBD-1 surface, §1). It inherits
 * that assumption from the shell rather than adding a new one, and deliberately does NOT
 * read `offsetTop` — see REQUIREMENT 2 above for what happens when you do.

/**
 * BulkActionBar — the selection bar for a multi-select list.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Purpose: REQ-UI-7's bulk destructive action, reachable on every viewport. Docked to
 * the bottom edge, lifted clear of the software keyboard by `useKeyboardInset()` and
 * clear of any PERSISTENT bottom chrome by `--ui-bottom-chrome`. It carries the
 * count, the verbs and Cancel — nothing else.
 *
 * **Why fixed on desktop too, rather than `sticky bottom-0`.** Sticky was the
 * original desktop treatment and it never worked: the bar is the last child of the
 * list column, so its containing block ENDS where the bar ends and sticky has zero
 * travel to move it within. The bar therefore rendered at its static position — the
 * bottom of a long list, far below the fold — so on desktop you ticked a row and the
 * verbs appeared somewhere off screen. Measured through the live app: Projects put
 * the bar at y=1084 in an 814px viewport, Memory at y=7050. Type-clean, invisible in
 * a short list, and caught only by measuring the bar's rect after a real click
 * (`scripts/ui-interaction-harness.mjs`, predicate "bulk bar sits above the bottom
 * chrome"). Fixed positioning has no such dependency on an ancestor's height.
 *
 * Because a fixed bar is out of flow, the component also renders an in-flow SPACER
 * of its own measured height, so the last row of a list is never hidden underneath
 * the verbs that act on it.
 *
 * Bottom chrome (the app's mobile tab bar) — the bar docks above it, not under it.
 * The offset is read from the `--ui-bottom-chrome` CSS variable, which the app shell
 * publishes on the document root from the real measured height of its tab bar
 * (`shell/responsive.tsx` › `MobileTabBar`). It is the component's own responsibility
 * and no caller passes anything: a prop would have to be remembered by every list
 * page on all five resources, and the height is the SHELL's fact, not the page's.
 * Absent the variable the fallback is `0px`, so `@ui` keeps zero knowledge of the
 * shell and the bar still docks correctly in a bare host (Storybook, tests).
 * The software keyboard wins while it is open: it covers the tab bar too, so the bar
 * sits on the keyboard rather than stacking both insets.
 *
 * NOT for: per-row actions (they belong in the row), or a page-level toolbar.
 *
 * Layer: composite. Product-agnostic: the verbs are `children`, so the bar knows
 * nothing about what is being archived, rejected or killed.
 *
 * The count label is the part that must not drift, so it is built in rather than left
 * to each caller: **"12 selected (of the 50 loaded)"**. Never "of all", and never a
 * total — the list APIs are keyset-paged and return no count, so any total would be a
 * promise the API cannot keep. `loadedCount` is the rows currently in hand.
 *
 * Touch (REQ-UI-19): multi-select must be reachable without hover, so the entry point
 * ships with the bar as `BulkActionBar.SelectToggle` — the header button that turns
 * select mode on and off. Nothing anywhere is hover-revealed.
 *
 * Accessibility (built in): the bar is a labelled `role="region"` with
 * `aria-live="polite"` on the count, so a screen reader hears the selection change
 * without the bar stealing focus.
 *
 * Tokens only. Escape hatch: `className` merges onto the root.

/**
 * shellModel — the Shells pages' shared vocabulary.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Inherited silently from actionModel/agentModel; only what DIFFERS is remarked.
 * A **shell session** is a live process the bridge is running on a host — started by
 * an agent, by `ham-ctl shell`, or by a chain — not something a person creates in the
 * UI. Everything below was verified in source; the citations are load-bearing.
 *
 * What differs for this resource, and why:
 *
 *  1. **No create, no edit (REQ-UI-15).** Sessions are runtime. The single mutable
 *     field, `server_port`, is a menu item plus the existing `SetShellPortDialog`,
 *     not a form page. §7 of the plan template is N/A here and deliberately so.
 *
 *  2. **The row's bottom-right time switches field with the row's own state.**
 *     A live session's meaningful time is `last_activity_at` — when it last spoke.
 *     A terminal one's is `finished_at` — when it stopped; its activity clock froze
 *     at that moment and reading it as "active 4h ago" would imply a process that is
 *     not there. `started_at` is the absolute in the `title` for both. Every other
 *     resource has one time field; this one honestly has two.
 *
 *  3. **Tabs are Live | Finished**, the `shell_session_is_terminal` split
 *     (`src/hub/domain/shell_session.odin:51`). Status itself is not a tab: a session
 *     moves starting -> running -> exited while it is being read, and a status tab
 *     would carry rows out from under the reader. The terminal split is the one line
 *     a row crosses exactly once.
 *
 *  4. **Verbs are asymmetric across that split, because the HUB is asymmetric** and
 *     this was checked rather than assumed:
 *       - kill    409s on a terminal session — `shell_session_service.odin:236`,
 *                 "session has already terminated". So Kill is not offered there.
 *       - signal  has NO terminal guard (`:249`) but a signal to a dead pid is a
 *                 no-op, so Interrupt is not offered there either.
 *       - restart has NO terminal guard (`:268`) and IS meaningful there — it is the
 *                 main reason to want it. It can still fail, because the bridge looks
 *                 the session up in an IN-MEMORY map (`hub_runtime_client.odin:2414`)
 *                 that a bridge restart empties. That failure gets its own copy
 *                 (`restartFailureText`) rather than a generic "Restart failed",
 *                 which would leave a user retrying something that cannot succeed.
 *       - port    is a property of a live session; the hub refuses it once terminal.
 *
 *  5. **No markdown anywhere.** REQ-UI-11 says a view page renders markdown "where the
 *     field is markdown". A shell has no such field — its body is a byte stream, and
 *     rendering a stream as markdown would mangle it. Read-only here means the user
 *     WATCHES output and cannot type into it: `/shells/:id/input` and `/resize` exist
 *     and these pages never call them.

 *
 * They QUALIFY status and never replace it, so nothing below branches on a status enum
 * value that does not exist. §8 is explicit about what must not happen: this state may
 * be rendered neither as plain `running` (which asserts something we do not know to be

 * terminal, the intent is cleared, and shell_session_exited lands on the user bus.
 *
 * WHAT THE COPY MUST GET RIGHT NOW IS TIMING, WHICH IS THE OTHER WAY TO LIE. Delivery
 * happens ON RECONNECT, not immediately, and the bridge may be gone for a long time.

 * the obvious path; Restart is the second one, and it was open. The owner-wide shells
 * list is deliberately UNSCOPED (per the chain description, "nothing may hide a user's
 * own runs"), so a user's `run` rows really do appear in this UI — and restart respawns
 * with run_seq+1, which is starting a run. A run is a one-shot command owned by the
 * agent that triggered it; re-running it is that agent's call.
 *
 * This is a UI gate and is NOT the enforcement point. shell_session_restart checks
 * ownership and nothing else — no starter rule, no kind branch — so the hub-side
 * backstop is still missing; that is REQ-SHELL-24, deliberately not fixed here. The
 * start path's own comment says why this matters: the rule "must be enforced at the API,
 * not only in the UI". Do not let this gate's existence read as that job being done.

 * answer rather than an oversight: kill 409s, a signal reaches no pid, a port cannot be
 * declared, there is nothing to preview, and restart belongs to the agent. Both call

// REQ-SHELL-52 AC4 — the COMMITTED GUARD for the `defer delete(frame)` in send_text.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, since the fix it guards is one line that is already in
// origin/main (4e4ff21e). The proof behind that push was a scratch probe that was
// deliberately NOT committed, so nothing stood between the `defer` and a future
// "tidy up the defers" pass. The census on REQ-SHELL-52 is the argument: there are FIVE
// copies of this frame writer in the tree, and the two that freed correctly were the two
// with a committed test near them. This writer family has had its duplicate count
// mis-stated three times (REQ-SHELL-33 stopped at three copies, 35 found the fourth, 47
// found the fifth and miscounted the leaks as one), so "someone will read the commit
// message" is not a guard.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS, AND WHY A GREEN SUITE IS NOT THE BAR. The suites were ALREADY green
// with the leak present — that is exactly how it survived. So these tests do not check
// that send_text works; they check that the heap is back where it started. Each runs on
// a mem.Tracking_Allocator and asserts BOTH halves, following the idiom in
// src/bridge/shell_cwd_test.odin:75 and shell_session_ownership_test.odin:506+527:
//
//   * allocation_map back at its baseline  -> the frame was freed (the LEAK half)
//   * bad_free_array empty                 -> it was freed ONCE, by its owner, with the
//                                             allocator it came from (the DOUBLE-FREE half)
//
// Asserting only the leak half would be the wrong single check here: `send_all_tcp` and
// `send_all_file` BORROW the slice, and if a future change made either of them free it,
// the leak count would read clean while a double free went latent. REQ-SHELL-50 already
// records 14 pre-existing bad frees in this codebase; this pair of assertions is what
// stops this writer from contributing the fifteenth.
//
// THE FAILURE-PATH TEST IS NOT REDUNDANT. `defer` covers every exit by construction
// today, but the original defect's severity came from send_all_tcp's THREE early returns
// (deadline, error, n<=0) each dropping the frame. A test that only ever exercises the
// success path would still pass if a future refactor replaced the `defer` with a single
// `delete(frame)` before `return true`.

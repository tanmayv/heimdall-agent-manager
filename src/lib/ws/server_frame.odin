// Server->client WebSocket text framing, shared by the hub's writers.
//
// REQ-SHELL-33. Every hub-side writer used to open with `if n > 65535 do return
// false`: the RFC 6455 126/2-byte extended length was implemented and the 127/8-byte
// one was not, so any larger payload was DROPPED, silently, on a bool that most
// callers ignore and that the one caller which did inspect it read as "the peer is
// dead". This is that missing protocol case, written once.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS FIXES BEYOND THE MISSING ARM:
//
//  1. THE RESULT IS TYPED. "I could not encode this frame" and "this socket is gone"
//     are different conditions with different recovery, and a bool cannot tell them
//     apart. shell_session_broadcast_output detaching a healthy viewer over an
//     oversized frame is exactly what collapsing them costs.
//
//  2. SHORT WRITES ARE HANDLED. core/net's _send_tcp returns on the first errno with
//     a possibly NON-ZERO total_written, so `_, err := net.send_tcp(...)` can leave
//     HALF A FRAME on the wire and report success-or-failure with no way to tell.
//     A peer that has read half a frame misparses it and every byte after it: the
//     stream is desynchronised permanently. That is worse than dropping the frame,
//     and .Desynchronised names it so the caller can end the session instead of
//     serving corruption. (lsp_write_ws_text_frame_counted reached the same
//     conclusion for the LSP socket; this generalises it.)
//
// WHY allow_64bit IS A PARAMETER AND NOT A CONSTANT. The two peer kinds cannot take
// the same answer:
//   - A BROWSER parses a 127-length frame correctly. It gets the 64-bit arm.
//   - OUR OWN READERS DO NOT. `take_text` in ws.odin drops the connection on a 127
//     length, and the hub's bridge_ws_take_frame returns fatal=true on it. Emitting
//     one toward a bridge would convert a dropped frame into a KILLED bridge
//     connection — strictly worse than the bug. The hub<->bridge channel keeps its
//     16-bit bound on purpose: it already chunks at the APPLICATION level (kind:
//     "chunk") precisely so no frame reaches the cap.
// Passing it at the call site makes that a stated property of each channel rather
// than an assumption buried in a writer.

// WHERE THIS DIVERGES FROM ITS PRIOR ART. lsp_write_ws_text_frame_counted
// (lsp_session_handlers.odin) already solved the same two problems for the LSP socket
// and this generalises it. Four deliberate differences:
//   1. A TYPED RESULT, not (sent, ok). The byte count drives no production decision —
//      lsp_registry_deliver branches on ok and uses `sent` only in its comment — and
//      what the count was actually being read for, "is a partial frame on the wire",
//      is what .Desynchronised says directly.
//   2. allow_64bit IS A PARAMETER. LSP has exactly one peer kind (a browser) so it can
//      hardcode the arm; this writer serves both kinds. See above.
//   3. AN EXPLICIT CAP. LSP has none; a hub-side buffer sized by a remote pane needs one.
//   4. A SHORT-WRITE LOOP — which, note, retries ONLY the no-error partial return and
//      bails on any error, .Would_Block included. That is what keeps it compatible with
//      LSP's SO_SNDTIMEO bound: a send timeout arrives as an error and ends the write
//      rather than being retried, so the wedged-peer recovery LSP_SEND_TIMEOUT exists
//      to provide is preserved, not defeated.

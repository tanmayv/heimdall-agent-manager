# REQ-SHELL-2 end-to-end: `run` and `serve` over the shared create path, with
# EXPLICIT backgrounding, against a real hub + a real bridge.
#
# What this covers that the unit tests cannot: the whole path, and specifically the
# AUTHORIZATION boundary. `run` is agent-only, so it is exercised with a genuine
# agent identity (bridge bearer + X-Heimdall-Instance-Token) rather than as a user
# — which is the only way to prove both that an agent CAN and a user CANNOT.
#
#   1. AC5   a USER creating kind=run is refused by the hub
#   2. AC1   an agent's foreground run blocks, returns output inline, notifies nothing
#   3. AC2   --bg returns immediately with a session id
#   4. AC4   BRIDGE_SHELL_ASYNC_THRESHOLD is GONE from the tree, and a >15s
#            foreground run still returns inline rather than being auto-backgrounded
#   5. AC6   rows carry agent_instance_id / chain_id / conversation id / cmd / cwd / pid
#   6. AC7   the spec file exists while live and is gone once terminal
#   7. AC8   DELETE kills an agent-started run and an agent-started server
#   8. AC9   output is readable on demand via /log and is NOT in the hub DB
#   9. AC11  serve is reachable through the existing preview/tunnel path; a serve
#            with no --port starts fine and exposes nothing
#  10. AC13  two live sessions cannot hold one port; the port is released on exit
#  11. AC14  over-cap creates are refused
#
# Stands up a THROWAWAY stack on its own ports and tears it down again. It never
# touches a stack it did not start: every process it launches is recorded by PID
# and only those PIDs are killed. (Do not "clean up" by pattern-matching command
# lines on a shared host — that takes down other people's stacks.)
#
# Usage:
#   tests/e2e_shell2_run_serve_test.sh
#
# Env (all optional):
#   S2_HUB_PORT     hub listen port                 (default 8593)
#   S2_PROXY_PORT   dev-proxy port (auth injection) (default 8592)
#   S2_BRIDGE_PORT  bridge service port             (default 49931)
#   S2_BRIDGE_LOCAL bridge local endpoint port      (default 49932)
#   S2_SERVE_PORT   port the test server binds       (default 8911)
#   S2_KEEP=1       leave the stack running afterwards
#   S2_SKIP_SLOW=1  skip the >15s foreground check (AC4's behavioural half)
#   ODIN            odin binary (default: odin on PATH, else via nix develop)
#
# Requires a working odin toolchain (the repo's nix dev shell provides one),
# python3 and curl. Exits 0 only if every check below passes.

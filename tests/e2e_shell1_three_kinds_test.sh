# REQ-SHELL-1 end-to-end: create a session of EACH of the three kinds over the
# REST API, against a real hub + a real bridge, and prove the per-kind scope rules
# are enforced server-side rather than only in the UI.
#
# What this covers that the unit tests cannot: the whole path. A kind string
# travels handler -> service validation -> sqlite row -> shell_start frame ->
# bridge spawn -> status back on the row. A rename or a scope rule that is right
# in the domain and wrong on the wire fails here and nowhere else.
#
#   1. run    — agent scoped: created WITH an agent_instance_id, rejected without
#   2. shell  — bridge scoped: created bare, rejected when handed a chain_id
#   3. server — chain+bridge scoped: created with a chain_id, rejected without
#   4. the retired vocabulary (command / interactive / agent) is refused, not aliased
#   5. a by-chain listing returns the server and NOT the agent-scoped run
#
# Stands up a THROWAWAY stack on its own ports and tears it down again. It never
# touches a stack it did not start: every process it launches is recorded by PID
# and only those PIDs are killed. (Do not "clean up" by pattern-matching command
# lines on a shared host — that takes down other people's stacks.)
#
# Usage:
#   tests/e2e_shell1_three_kinds_test.sh
#
# Env (all optional):
#   S1_HUB_PORT     hub listen port                 (default 8493)
#   S1_PROXY_PORT   dev-proxy port (auth injection) (default 8492)
#   S1_BRIDGE_PORT  bridge service port             (default 49831)
#   S1_BRIDGE_LOCAL bridge local endpoint port      (default 49832)
#   S1_KEEP=1       leave the stack running afterwards
#   ODIN            odin binary (default: odin on PATH, else via nix develop)
#
# Requires a working odin toolchain (the repo's nix dev shell provides one),
# python3 and curl. Exits 0 only if every check below passes.

# REQ-SHELL-2 UPDATE: `run` became AGENT-ONLY, enforced at the API. This script
# creates a run to prove its SCOPE rules, so it now needs a real agent identity —
# a user-authenticated create of kind=run is refused with 403 before scope is ever
# reached, which would make every run assertion below fail for the wrong reason.
#
# The agent instance is created through the user API, then acted for with the
# bridge bearer plus the instance assertion header, which is exactly how the
# bridge relays an agent's own REST call.
# The agent instance the run tests act as.
#
# SEEDED DIRECTLY INTO THE HUB DB, on purpose. Creating one through the API
# requires a PROVIDER to be installed and enabled on the bridge (an agent instance
# is something the hub can launch), and this suite is about shell sessions, not
# about agent launching — making it depend on a provider binary would make it fail
# on hosts where nothing is wrong with the code under test.
#
# Nothing about the AUTHORIZATION path is shortcut by this: the hub still verifies
# the bridge bearer token, still looks the instance up, still checks the instance
# belongs to the calling bridge, and still matches the assertion header. Only the
# instance's creation is bypassed, and no assertion below depends on how it was
# created.

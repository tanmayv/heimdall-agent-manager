// E1 / REQ-UNSEAL-1..5: bridge unseal must behave IDENTICALLY whether the vault key was
// typed this session or restored from IndexedDB on a page reload.
//
// The defect these tests pin: `setActiveVaultKey(key, hex?)` kept a second module-level
// copy of the raw key as hex, and its optional `hex` parameter gave it a silent THIRD
// branch -- a truthy key with `hex` omitted (as opposed to explicitly `null`) installed
// the key and left the hex copy at whatever a previous caller had left there. Six of the
// ten call sites took that branch, the IndexedDB restore at app boot among them, while
// the "operator typed the key" path passed the hex explicitly. `prepareUnsealPayload`
// then read that cache from a `catch` block, so an unseal succeeded in the session where
// the key was typed and threw `'...no active key hex is cached.'` after any reload. Same
// user, same vault, same bridge: the outcome depended only on reload history.
//
// The fix deletes the cache rather than populating it on both paths (which would have
// meant raw key material at rest, the exact exposure REQ-VAULT-HARDEN exists to remove).
// So what is asserted below is CONVERGENCE: both entry paths now hold the same thing, are
// refused by unseal in the same way, and succeed in the same way once the caller passes
// the key material explicitly.
//
